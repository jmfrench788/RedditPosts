# Reddit Posts WebApp MVP

Taking the titles of the reddit posts from the LifeProTips, I separated the words for each, got the count of how many times they were used and then came up with a collection of words for different categories. 

Frequency is words that describe the frequency of something like "never, always, usually, sometimes, etc"

Technology is words like "tv, app, ads, gmail, netflix, spotify, youtube, computer, internet, phone."

I plotted both above, but I need to make some visual edits to the graphs.

I still need to finish the categories "romance, school, family, health, age, and work" and plot them. 

Then I am going to get a total sum for each category and plot them together. 

Then I need to make the web app.
