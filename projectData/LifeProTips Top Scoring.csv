When I got up and saw that I missed it, I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses, in the hope that maybe, just maybe, they'd be understanding and give me another chance. 

Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

Don't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.

y4o1fa,cyberkrist,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/y4o1fa/,LifeProTips,"LPT: Stop engaging with online content that makes you angry! The algorithms are keeping you angry, turning you into a zealot, and you aren't actually informed!",TRUE,"We all get baited into clicking on content that makes us angry, or fuels ""our side"" of a contentious topic.  The problem is that once you start engaging with ""rage bait"" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.

You feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things.  First your anger obviously.  But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more ""correct"" than they/you actually are.  You start to fall into the trap of ""echo chambers"", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions.

For example:  If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions.  This causes the following

* You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority
* You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters
* You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing  view
* You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber)

Make a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively.  Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want.  You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you.  The people fighting back and forth online over the issues of the day are a small minority of people that represent nobody, nor are they representative of even their side.

They‚Äôve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It‚Äôs become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Looks bloody awful over in America, those wildfires are right nasty. Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. 



1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. 


People here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes.


Firefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge.




2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with  DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS!

Please fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets,  a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat.

Wet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet!




3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way.




4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now.  Your life is worth more than stuff.



5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. 


People on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone.  Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it.  You're going to lose your house, get out now.




6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked.  Don't die for stuff.  Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets.

Stay safe America!

: EDIT :


I had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends üí™ and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much.

: POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING :

A Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be.

NEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels.

Actually I'm a chick ‚úåÔ∏è

Large bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time.

NEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend. Wool is best on a budget, duvetyne is probably the best material available, 100% cotton towels will also work in a pinch. Never synthetic .

Wow this really blew up. I'm fucking honoured, and I'm glad to see so many people out there really giving a shit about fire safety.

My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.

I've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.

I happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip. It surprisingly saves a lot of time, hassle and effort if you don't mind working a little later.

egs81p,Racefiend,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/,LifeProTips,LPT: Some tips for buying a used car for people that know nothing about cars,TRUE,"I‚Äôm a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I‚Äôd put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn‚Äôt know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don‚Äôt know how many people I‚Äôve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it‚Ä¶.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that‚Äôs not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:

1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don‚Äôt need to spend a lot, as they‚Äôll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don‚Äôt have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.

So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there‚Äôs an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it‚Äôs pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they‚Äôre not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn‚Äôt have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!

Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven‚Äôt passed, then it‚Äôs quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there‚Äôs a problem that isn‚Äôt allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.

2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what‚Äôs known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don‚Äôt revv up the engine too high and try it again. You‚Äôll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it‚Äôs easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.

For reference, here‚Äôs what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)

Here‚Äôs what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It‚Äôs at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)

If you listen closely, you‚Äôll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.

If the car you‚Äôre looking at doesn‚Äôt have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don‚Äôt. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you‚Äôre looking at with something like ‚ÄúYYYY Make Model clear flood‚Äù or  ‚ÄúYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump‚Äù and see if there‚Äôs an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.

Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.

3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don‚Äôt have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you‚Äôre SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it‚Äôs rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it‚Äôs just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford‚Äôs yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That‚Äôs dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven‚Äôt been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That‚Äôs bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that‚Äôs really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That‚Äôs checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don‚Äôt have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you‚Äôre SOL there.

4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it‚Äôs at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.

5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they‚Äôve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It‚Äôs better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that‚Äôs better. Indy‚Äôs will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that‚Äôs the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that‚Äôs wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don‚Äôt do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn‚Äôt even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.

6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?

7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can‚Äôt see?

8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.

9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they‚Äôre cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.

10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn‚Äôt want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They‚Äôll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They‚Äôll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you‚Äôre buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.

11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you‚Äôre done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don‚Äôt be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it‚Äôs not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you‚Äôre test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it‚Äôs right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.

12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It‚Äôs also pretty important. You‚Äôll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it‚Äôs injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that‚Äôs rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it‚Äôs adding, but sometimes it‚Äôs subtracting). I don‚Äôt like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.

So what you‚Äôre going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it‚Äôs always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You‚Äôre going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find ‚Äúshort term fuel trim‚Äù and ‚Äúlong term fuel trim‚Äù. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.

Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%

Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%

Let‚Äôs assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You‚Äôre going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the ‚Äúbank‚Äù or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one ‚Äúside‚Äù so you‚Äôll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you‚Äôll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don‚Äôt be alarmed if you‚Äôre looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn‚Äôt control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.

When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you‚Äôll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples on a V8:

STFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6

LTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1

So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That‚Äôs pretty good.

STFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3

LTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1

Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that‚Äôs good.

STFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7

LTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15

Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That‚Äôs not good. Walk away from this one.

Here's one more that's a littlte different:

STFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20

LTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20

Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.

Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.

Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.

13. Last and not least, don‚Äôt trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don‚Äôt know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you‚Äôre worried about is no big deal, it‚Äôs just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it‚Äôs a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn‚Äôt seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don‚Äôt consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.

I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents‚Äô cars, friends‚Äô cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you‚Äôre doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won‚Äôt forget anything.

EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.

When the only way out is through, turn and face the discomfort, take a deep breath and walk towards it.

Your brain is your hype man, and tries very hard to prove you right using emotions as feedback. Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.

If your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going ""nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback."" You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain's response to the stimulus around you (emotions).

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",64924,4377

There is almost nothing you can do, so never assume you have privacy.",TRUE,"In light of the class action lawsuit against Google for continuing to track visitors' private sessions, I went down a rabbit hole to see if it was possible to avoid being ""fingerprinted"" by websites like Amazon &amp; Google.

Turns out, it's almost impossible. There is literally almost *nothing* you can do to stop these websites from tracking your actions. I can't believe there haven't been MASSIVE class-action lawsuits against these companies before now. The current private-browsing suit doesn't even scratch the surface.

Even when you delete your Cookies, clear your Cache, and use a VPN or a browser like Brave (effectively telling websites you do NOT want to be tracked), these websites will still track &amp; build every action you take into a robust profile about who you are, what you like, and where you go.

This goes deeper than just websites. Your Spotify music history is added into this profile, your Alexa searches, your phone's GPS data, any text you have typed into your phone, and more. Companies like Amazon and Google purchase all of this and build it into your profile.

So when you are 'Fingerprinted' by these websites, it's not just your past website history they are attaching to your session. It's **every single thing about you.**

This should be illegal; consumers should have the right to private sessions, should they chose. During this time of quarantine, there is no alternative option: we are forced to use many of these sites. As such, this corporate behavior is unethical, immoral, and in legal terms, a contract of adhesion as consumers are forced into wildly inappropriate terms that erase their privacy.

**TL;DR LPT**: You are being fingerprinted and tracked by Google, Amazon, every other major website. Not just your website actions, but your Spotify listening history, phone GPS data, Alexa searches, emails, and more are all bought &amp; built into these 'fingerprint' profiles.

When in doubt, don't water. Other beginner tips in the post.",TRUE,"Many people enthusiastically bring home a pretty houseplant for the first time, and proceed to water it every day to keep it happy. While understandable, you're setting yourself for heartbreak and frustration.  It is natural to assume that the one thing we know we have to do to plants should be done often, and the more often the better, but root rot is usually not fixable and will slowly kill your lovely plant. Underwatering, on the other hand, can be fixed very easily. As a rule of a thumb, once a week is perfect for most plants. 


Missing the outdoors and ending up with about 60 houseplants through a year of lockdown, I have learned that majority of them prefer to be left to their own devices. Here is a rather conclusive guide working for vast majority of widely available plants:




- give them a sunny spot. Seems obvious, but we might be tempted to place them for aesthetics out of sun. There are plants that don't mind (ferns are the best example), but most do. Give them sun or grow light. Remember that more sun makes them dry up more often (so on a sunny window sill, water once every 5 days, in a shadowy corner, once every week)



- once every 2 weeks, take a soft cloth, slightly wet, and clean the leaves. Dust sets on them as well, and it makes it harder for them to undertake photosynthesis properly. It is also a rather soothing activity. Everyone wins. 




- get a plant food. They are usually cheap and you can also make your own, and they can make your plant grow like crazy. Don't overfertilise tho - about once every 3 months enough. Too much fertiliser is a thing, and it can burn them. Don't fertilise in the winter. 



- ‚ö†Ô∏è on the topic of eating, many houseplants are toxic to pets if ingested. If you have pets, particularly playful ones, make sure to research ahead to avoid trouble! 



- Don't rush to repot. I know you want to put them in these cute pots you got, but keep them in nursery pots for at least a month. Many plants experience environmental change shock between you taking them from the store and bringing them home, so don't make it harder for them, they will thank you with many happy years in those sweet pots of yours. 



- speaking of pots, always have drainage. Try not to put plants straight into a decorative pot without drainage - get a bigger planter and put it in with nursery pot and tray.




- chop of leaves that go yellow - they won't go green again, and the plant is wasting resources on it. 




- if cactuses or succulents, you still have to water them, albeit rarely. Many people recommend cactuses as the most beginner houseplants, but you can absolutely kill both cactuses and succulents, and not only as a beginner (I'll be the first one to admit I've killed a few). But even if they do not die on you, they will not look as lush as when bought in few months unless quite a lot of care is given. If you really want an unkillable plant, get a pothos or peace lily. They both droop when thirsty (so they give you a clear indication as to when to water them), have a lovely chunky foliage, are quite cheap and very sturdy. Another great ones are snake plants. Most cactuses and succulents would go on 4th and 5th place on the ""hardest to kill"" list. 





- your plant may experience a bit of a shock after about half a year since you bought it, as the fertiliser given in store usually runs out around that time. Don't panic, it is not dying, just give it a little love and plant food and it will be happy again. 



Follow these and you should be just fine for the majority of plants.



Houseplanrs are awesome decorations that can light up any place, and more than you think are extremely low maintenance. It is a nice hobby for the soul, and don't stress if you kill one, happens to everyone every now and then. Some species are drama queens, and some specimen of no-fuss plants are ungrateful bastards.

Throughout his decline, I saw my family approach it in one of two ways: some would try to correct his mistakes over and over (to no avail), and some would just roll with the punches.   


Playing along with things in the moment always seemed to keep him more centered and grounded. Not only did it help calm him down, it made those painful visits a little less so by knowing he felt comforted by my validating his reality, and not trying to yank him out of whatever timeline/alternate universe he was visiting.   


A simple example would be if he asked where his (long dead) mother was, I would just say ""she's visiting with your sister and will be back soon."" What good would correcting him do? Then he'd have to re-live that trauma of losing his mom all over again, possibly many times a day.

&amp;nbsp;

When applying for jobs, or in interviews they want examples, not just  ""I can do *X*"", **prove** to them you *can* do *X*. 

It's ok to say ""I can code, deal with angry customers, I can manage employees"" - Anyone can say anything... But that's just empty words without backing up your statement/argument.

CAR is brief and to the point - Problem with that though, is when you apply for more senior jobs, they want a more in-depth application/interview...That's where S.T.A.R comes in.

S.T.A.R breaks down a scenario in to many pieces, creating a very detailed answer - You should always try to use STAR over CAR.

‚ÄúI pay attention to what makes you curse!‚Äù

So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. 
 
Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. 
 
The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.

2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received. 
 

 
To clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info. 
 
1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system. 
 
2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card ""that was hacked"". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to ""lock"" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into. 
 
3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff. 
 
4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)

I see this post reached some of its targeted audience and brought out the trolls and hatred of others. 

I'd like to give some background before I move on. This post was not intended to be Identical to any others out there. I posted this after having a conversation with one of the people under me who wanted to call in today. Our work is paying for his college, but having him come in to make up hours he misses due to school. He's running behind on homework and wanted a day off to catch back up. I told him I didn't need any explanation. Just don't come in. He has 7 vacation days which can be used as PTO. I as the supervisor and the company do NOT need a reason for his use of PTO/Vacation time.

I'd like to thank those who posted great ideas and stories regarding their past experiences with prior jobs, Either being screwed over or helping those under them realize this as well.

I'll post some of the comments and remarks a bit now, to help stop the identical spam posts.

**-You'll Get Fired-** Is one of the most commented posts on here. Yes, there is always a risk of getting fired, But if a company wants to fire you for using your PTO or Vacation days, then is that really a place you want to stay at? 

**-Only Privileged People can do this-** As seen below in quite a few popular comments, Privileged people get way too many PTO/Vacation days and can bargain for more. Those who are less privileged rarely get time off. Jobs such as retail claim you can schedule unpaid days off, then turn around and deny them, forcing you to use their trash point system, until you're forced to come in every day or get fired. 

**-As a XXX This advice doesn't work for me-**  I understand that some fields, such as Military, Teaching, Railroad, etc, can't take time off due to either contracts or legal reasons. However, this post wasn't fully intended for your positions. There are a lot of young adults out there that work at retail or fast food jobs that are getting screwed over by their management and scheduling teams. I faced the same thing when I started working years ago. This is just personal advice I wish I knew when I was younger.

**-It's Vice Versa, Not Visa Versa-** Alright grammar police, I'm not a robot. I make mistakes just as well as everyone else.",54713,1563
ehnjae,VerySlump,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ehnjae/,LifeProTips,"LPT: When you receive a hospital bill, ask them for an itemized bill and it will be much cheaper",TRUE,"Example: You get an expensive bill for a $1,000 unfortunately. U.S. healthcare really shouldn‚Äôt be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. 

They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I‚Äôve mentioned, they‚Äôll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.
 
Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.

If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!

You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.

If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren‚Äôt even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!

You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. 

Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.

EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there‚Äôs some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don‚Äôt think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation.

I'm 48 years old. A little over ten years ago I was in the car pickup line at my daughter's school. She was in second grade. It was a warm spring day so we were all standing around outside our cars. This chubby guy was standing outside an orange Mini Cooper. I nodded and made the random nice car comment. He said its name was Oliver. Oh, like Hammond's car in Top Gear? His eyes lit up. Friendliest guy in the world, he came over and we started chatting. Found out we had nearly everything in common, and were best friends from that moment forward.

It's so rare to make any friends in your 30s with a family, much less a best bud. Our daughters were the same age and were immediate best friends too. Same with our wives. It was weird, we were all so much alike and got on so well. I helped them move, Joe helped me with some projects at home. We went to see Deadpool about a dozen times.

Last summer Joe, in his early 40s, had been having some stomach issues for a few weeks, then passed out at work. They did tests. Found a sizeable tumor in his colon. Chemo. Surgery. Complications. Another surgery. Another. More chemo when the last surgery found that the cancer had ""spread significantly.""

Joe was brought home from the hospital a couple days ago to be put in hospice. My wife and I are going over to see him later this afternoon.

To say goodbye.

I'm loading up a couple episodes of Top Gear on my tablet and am going to just sit with my buddy one more time.

Guys... Get checked. Get your colonoscopies. If something doesn't feel right, go to the doctor immediately and get it checked.

-----------
Editing to add because it looks like a common question. I'm no doc but I saw a GI doc comment that the current recommendation is for all adults over 45 to get a colonoscopy, potentially earlier if you have family history. 

And thank you everyone for the kind words. Wife and I are about to head over to Joe's. Gotta hold it together for him. I can cry in the car afterward.

**Transitional Living Program:**  Must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, job help, nutrition, budgeting ,etc.

**Street Outreach Program:** My favorite program. Outreach workers meet youth where they are at on the streets, in parks, etc. These outreach workers adjust to whatever level of support you need- they could just drop off food and warm clothes or they could help you access emergency shelter and sign up for health insurance.

**National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY or [http://www.1800runaway.org/](http://www.1800runaway.org/). They were an actual switchboard back in the day that would allow kids to contact their families if they ran away. Now they have forums on their website where thousands of kids ask a ton of questions FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD about how to be safe. They work with Greyhound to provide bus trips home for runaway youth and also do a lot of outreach around issues concerning runaway and homeless youth.

When I was a teenager, they never let me sleep over 8AM, even during summer holidays.

About Boss and Coworkers....In 5 months I'll become a doctor. Healthcare, depending on your speciality and job is one sector where sleep and mental health is actually ignored. I see my interns/ house surgeons staying awake   36 hours. Sometimes the job requires it. Night duties are a part of the job. Even during our undergraduate it's considered very normal to lose sleep over studying for tests and exams. Most of them sleep hardly 3 -  5 hours before  University exams. It has kinda become the norm. And yes I've heard my own friends bragging about how less they slept the previous day. It's pathetic.

In our student life these kinda extreme situations happen before exams and our exams go over a month.

When we don't have exams, I keep my sleep the highest priority more than my studies and try to eat well and exercise. I'll take the stress when I have to, just before the exams.

For a lot of cases, I'll add more bags: an oxygen kit, a resuscitation kit, an airway bag, sometimes specialised lifting equipment. We carry a lot of stuff, and generally the more I carry, the more concerned I am about the person I'm about to assess.

It's a very natural reflex to welcome someone to your house by holding the door open. The actual effect is to stand in the door frame while I try to squeeze past you with hands full. Then, once I've moved past you, I don't know where to go.

**Instead, it's much more helpful simply to open the door and let me keep it open myself, then simply lead the way.** I don't need free hands to hold the door for myself, and it clears my path to walk in more easily.

As a manager, it‚Äôs a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I‚Äôm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	Most importantly, where I‚Äôm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they‚Äôve been forced to ‚Äúwork themselves out of a job‚Äù then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it‚Äôs not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you‚Äôre in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren‚Äôt so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I‚Äôve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation.

And in most states, if an employee is fired for cause, and the employer states the firing happened because the employee didn't meet the job requirements or didn't do their job correctly, the former employee might not be eligible for unemployment insurance.

The result is that in a lot of toxic corporations, management will sometimes set up some of their employees for failure. They will for instance put them on a so-called [performance improvement plan](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/exreq/pages/details.aspx?erid=586), or start micromanaging them to death, documenting anything that can be perceived as failures or mistakes using brand new standards. It can also be implemented as part of a [vitality curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve), where bottom performers are regularly purged from the organization, regardless of the company's results.

It's also sometimes implemented in perverse manners when a company is looking to lay off a percentage of their workforce, and managers are instructed to meet a number within their reports. Some employees, identified as financial liabilities because they might work in a support quality but not directly generate revenues, suddenly see their performance reviews peppered with what were in fact minor issues, but that were inflated to turn them into causes for firing.

And if the employee is fired for cause, they might not be eligible for unemployment insurance, reducing the unemployment insurance tax the employer will have to pay in the future.

Bottomline is this: if an employer suddenly starts playing this trick on you, where you were performing just fine but are now having to jump through hoops, it means your ass has been put on the chopping block. You've been set up to fail, and you will almost certainly be fired soon. Start looking for a job. The good news is that unemployment rates has rarely been this low.

EDIT: Some people in here rightfully pointing that a PIP is not some evil tool and that it can be used to help a struggling employee to succeed. This is not the scenario this LPT is about.

Most of this isn‚Äôt caused by things are degenerative disorders (while that can most certainly be the case) but mostly due to a sedentary lifestyles leading weak muscles which further causes joint instability and increased disc and cartilage stress in those joints. 

I‚Äôve seen so many elderly people come in with backs that look like question marks and people in wheelchairs due to severe osteoarthritis in their knees and hips. The best way to prevent this down the road is to strengthen the muscles around joints to give them stability and strengthen the bones themselves through weight lifting.  

The key is to just stay active and try to incorporate exercises or stretches that strengthen your back, hip, and knees. You don‚Äôt have to go out and try to deadlift or squat 350lbs. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day and neither will your muscles and joints. Sedentary? Start with a walk and gradually build from there. Kind of active? Hit the gym and train these muscles.

ilrdua,frontendben,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ilrdua/,LifeProTips,"LPT: When negotiating a salary for a new job, always ask them what their range is. If they tell you 'we don't have a range' they're almost always lying. HR and finance will almost never sign off hiring a new employee without a budget being in place.",TRUE,"As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made as possible. The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.

Once you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.

However ‚Äì and this is the important bit ‚Äì if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.

To get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.

(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a ¬£6k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers ‚Äì all above the original top end of their budget).

Now the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.

If the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful ‚Äì especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process. Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them.

And even if that isn't the case, consider carefully whether you really want to work for a company where there is a culture of lying to you before you've even been hired.",48723,1567

Westfield is a chain of shopping centres in the UK, AU, &amp; US. In the moment of panic, I went to the bathroom, I realise too it probably wasn‚Äôt the best space to go.

I was at Westfield pretty late writing my thesis paper \~23:00, and after I got up to leave, I noticed the only other guy in the area leave as well. Typically I'm the only left because I stay back past dinner and had thought he would naturally just leave when all the restaurants closed (Westfield closed at midnight, and all shops were closed.) I got some creepy vibes from him so I walked some loops from L3 to L1 and he was still following me. I went to the bathroom to calm myself, spent about 20mins there and called an uber (normally I walk home because it's pretty safe at night, but I felt if I left the centre where there were no cameras it would be safer to catch a ride). When I came out, I thought I must've spent long enough in there, and he had left but he was sitting on a bench obscured by the elevators ahead. I walked past him as discreetly as possible, towards the parking lot but he got up and followed me too. So I went back round to the supermarket, the only place I knew would still be open and walked around aimlessly until I saw a couple walk in for some late-night grocery shopping. I was afraid to inconvenience them but ended up asking if they could accompany me whilst I waited. I explained I'd been followed and didn't feel safe, and if they could walk with me to the car park where my uber would arrive. They agreed, and once it came, I thanked them and yeeted out of there.

If I had walked home alone maybe something bad could have happened to me, maybe not. All I know is that I didn't feel safe. I don't know who needs to hear this but don't let politeness or fear of inconveniencing someone - it could be stranger, adult, or friend, to stop you from seeking help.

Edit 2: There seems to be a lot of fussing and feuding in the comments, so I'll address that. A university lecturer here in the UK is simply someone who teaches at a university. I know in some other places we are called ""professors"", but that's kind of an inaccurate term, since we are rarely professors in terms of our qualifications. A professorship in terms of the qualification comes after a doctorate. I personally have a doctorate, and thus my title is ""doctor"", but that's entirely different to a MEDICAL doctor (M.D), which I am very much not. At any rate, you don't even need to be a doctor to teach at a university here in the UK, just someone experienced in the field you're teaching in (my doctorate isn't even remotely related to games development, which is what I teach, for example). I wonder whether people are thinking I'm claiming to be a medical doctor or something? My doctorate is in a subject related to medicine, but I am not qualified as a literal MEDICAL DOCTOR, as in someone who can treat you in a hospital and prescribe medication etc. Do I sound that intelligent to you?? Trust me, I'm not XD

Maybe people are confused because a doctorate simply means you've completed a doctorate (often called an ""academic/research degree"") in the UK? Anyone can apply to do one, and universities frequently publish requests for people to apply to undertake them. In my case, I was required to take an MPhil (Master of Philosophy) course before I began the doctorate. That's pretty standard since I didn't have one yet, and someone else was funding my doctorate application.

e0eqyz,BleedBluePunk,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/,LifeProTips,LPT TIPS: What you should never to bring to a dry cleaners,TRUE,"I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

EDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

DOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

COMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

SPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

WEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

LEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&amp;#x200B;

WORTH IT:

MEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

WOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

D/C Only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.

Oil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

Also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

Bottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  If your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.",47057,1351

If you don‚Äôt like the offer you get, hire an independent appraiser.",TRUE,"EDIT: this only applies to the USA and varies by state 

My wife‚Äôs 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee was recently rear ended. After having about $5k worth of damage repaired, I filed a diminished value claim. Progressive Insurance (the insurance of the person who was at fault) offered me $400. I said no. They then offered $600. I said no. The body shop who fixed the car recommended an independent appraiser who they said almost always gets you more money. I paid him $300 for an appraisal report that showed that the value based on auctions etc is between 2-3k. I sent that report to Progressive. They reviewed it and then had their appraiser do their own research and then contacted my appraiser to negotiate a ‚Äúsettlement‚Äù. We agreed on $2100. 

The independent appraiser told me not enough people know about diminished value claims. He said if you have a later model car with under X miles (varies by state), it‚Äôs a no brainer claim but never accept the insurance company‚Äôs offer because they will low ball you a lot until you bring them evidence otherwise. All this cost me was $300 and 45 min of my time to have the appraiser see and take photos of the vehicle.


EDIT 1: As someone posted below, the ability to get a claim does depend on the make and model of your car and it's value. I should add that the independent adjuster I talked to gave me a ballpark value of what he thought the claim should be before I ever paid him a penny. He did say in some cases, it may not be worth it but knowing the details of my car (age, mileage, condition), I was getting low balled. You mileage may vary.

EDIT 2: As many have stated, Diminished Value laws vary by state so please check state laws before filing as to not waste your time (or money). Every state may have different time frames for when you can file.

For a complete overview of the pathogenesis of the rhinovirus (a virus responsible for the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses) check out [this article](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/pats.201006-039RN). Some key excerpts are:
- ‚ÄúThe most common way to ‚Äò‚Äòcatch a cold‚Äô‚Äô is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIt is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.‚Äù

Hence, this LPT. It‚Äôs based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one‚Äôs hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes). 

The study ""Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study."" specifically concludes that ""infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands"" led to a ""substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection"" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk). 

In the article ""Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu"" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like:
- ""To infect someone, these particles don‚Äôt have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface ‚Äî eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!""
- ""Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can‚Äôt stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes.""

A 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled ""TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES"" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected. 

The 2015 study ""Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers"" states ""person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes."" and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.

I did it this year for both parents and they were the two best presents I've ever received",TRUE,"As the children of parents we have a very one way relationship. We see our parents as parents, not people. And for most of childhood that is essentially a service role - they do things for you, you take things from them.

I'm now in my 30s and I realized I only knew a few select moments in both of their lives before I existed. A couple of highlights, but nothing that really painted a picture about how they came to be the people they were as adults. 

So a couple of years ago I asked them both to write down their story for my birthday. Of course, this was a difficult request for them - getting me some socks or a couple of books feels way more comfortable. But I pushed them on it, helped manage their expectations and made it clear I wasn't expecting Ulysses, and stood firm on the request. 

One year later and my birthday comes around again and this time I got the presents I asked for. Instantly read them cover to cover (I mean, one was 4 pages typed up, and the other was a small handwritten book, so it didn't take too long for either of us), and they were so amazing. So much stuff I didn't know about them both. And not just events, but feelings, attitudes, perspectives, and insight into them both as people rather than just parents.

So this is my LPT to you. I am lucky enough to still have both of my parents, but quite a lot of my peers do not, and it really makes me appreciate that I still have the time to do this. If you are in a similar position then I promise you, you will never have a better birthday present than finding out who your parents were before you threw their life into chaos.",45792,828

Consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/eReader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.",TRUE,"Note: *This is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

I was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*


Edit 1

irgh41,fliptrip,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/irgh41/,LifeProTips,LPT: There are other search engines than Google's. You can choose to protect your privacy or plant trees while you search.,TRUE,"Some of my personal choices in alphabetical order:

[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) doesn't track you, simple as that. Downside is that it doesn't know you, your preferences and so on. But that's kind of the point.

[Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) plants trees. Based on Bing. Has been my personal choice for years. Sometimes when I'm not satisfied by the search results I type in #g to be redirected to Google, which in my experience is very seldom more fruitful.

[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is quite useful in academics. If you're not sure how to cite a source in e.g. APA-style, Google scholar helps you out.

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is supposed to be really good for answering (numerical) questions. Plots functions which is nice. Haven't used it much for some reason.

There are many other alternatives, so if you know some specific search engines that you find helpful, please let us know in the comments!
Wikipedia also has a great [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines).

Another matter is Google translate. Depending on your language it can be less than perfect. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) does neural machine translation and has much better results. It only translates Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. It's pretty good at translating English to German and vice versa. I don't have a clue how the performance is in other languages though. Let me know if there has been some kind of breakthrough in translating Finnish.

Shouldn't forget maps. Google has great satellite images and street view. [Bing](https://www.bing.com/maps/) often has better aerial views. Check out if there are better local resources that have e.g. topographic maps which are just on another level, especially if you hike or are prone to getting lost in the woods. Get a compass while you're at it. I love maps in general btw. So [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) has to be mentioned. It's collaborative and non-commercial. Check it out and help to make it more precise locally!

English isn't my first language, and I'm also a grammarnazi, so please point out any mistakes that I made. +Shoutout to the Ask Jeeves crew! Yes, you are old, but maybe a bit wiser too. :)

EDIT: Oh my, over a thousand comments now, can't interact with everyone anymore. Thanks to everybody that has joined this discussion! To address a few concerns about me basically advertising for Ecosia. That's a valid critique, and now I feel a bit naive about well, kind of advertising for them. Commenters have come to my rescue in a way by confirming (with sources) that it is indeed a legitimate enterprise that uses the money they make to fund others that plant trees. Don't believe me, check it out yourself. I'm not their freaking spokesperson. I genuinely like to use it, and that crept into my post and maybe it shouldn't have. We have to live with that now. Oh, and their tree count is approximate. Go and count the trees at their different projects and update the database if that bothers you so much.

Next! Basically every online translator engine uses neural machine translation. WolframAlpha is not a search engine, but a computational knowledge engine, which understandably is a bit different to the former concept. What else? Oh, I actually was about to include bing/videos (for your preferred sexual practices), but left it out because I wasn't sure if it is still relevant. According to some commenters it is. So happy masturbating to everyone! Anyway, there haven't been many comments about alternatives, in search engines is what I mean. I would have made a list, but the wiki list above is pretty extensive anyway. I have to say that I'm amazed that my little thought has sparked such a great and civil discussion amongst you guys.

kaj4ff,wheresyourpickle,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kaj4ff/,LifeProTips,"LPT: if you call a suicide hotline and get put on hold, it‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt care about you! We also don‚Äôt read off of scripts. Other misconceptions below.",TRUE,"I have worked at a suicide hotline for about 2 years now and I have found that there are many misconceptions about suicide and crisis hotline workers and volunteers.  I can‚Äôt speak for every organization, but I hope that I can address a few of the general concerns that I see now so that you feel more comfortable calling.

1.  ‚ÄúWhy did I get put in a queue? Do they not care that I‚Äôm about to kill/hurt myself?‚Äù  We absolutely DO CARE! Please, please stay on the line.  At my organization, when you call you first talk to a ‚Äúcrisis screener‚Äù who‚Äôs job it is to take down whatever information you want to give them and then send you to one of two queues.  One queue is for people actively wanting to commit suicide and the other is for people in general crisis but not suicidal.  This is where some people get stuck on hold for a while because we are actively taking calls from the queue as they come in.  Every night is different and every shift is different. Sometimes I‚Äôll get 3 calls in 4 hours and I can really take my time with each person.  Other times, we have 10 people waiting in the queue but I still want to give each person their respective time to de-escalate.  We can also see if someone has dropped from the queue and it always makes me sad to see that someone hung up.  I want to talk to you. We all want to help.

2. ‚ÄúWorkers just talk from a script so there‚Äôs no point in calling‚Äù.  This is absolutely not true.  When you talk to me, I‚Äôm given a blank notepad and that‚Äôs it.  Through extensive training, we learn about ways to help you de-escalate your thoughts, open up and feel comfortable, and help you specifically identify what you are feeling in a crisis moment.  Our onboarding teachers really focused on how every caller is different and every situation is case-dependent. I would never boil down your experiences to a script. 

3. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call again tonight because I‚Äôve already called once and I‚Äôm going to bother them‚Äù.  Please feel comfortable calling as many times as you need if you are in active crisis.  Most likely you won‚Äôt even be talking to the same phone worker as everyone goes into the same queue.  I would say about 50% of my calls are people who I regularly hear from every day/week - they say their name or I recognize their voices.  20% are likely callers who have already called once in the night and need to talk again.  This is perfectly fine and I‚Äôm happy to explore what worked for you last time you called and what can work again this time.

4. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to hang up on me‚Äù.  We are not allowed to hang up on anyone (and I wouldn‚Äôt want to) unless they are being abusive to us or won‚Äôt let us speak.  We get a surprising amount of prank calls and people who call just to scream at us.  THAT BEING SAID - I have accidentally hung up on people before.  I feel absolutely horrible when this happens but I hope that everyone knows that they should call back.  If I am actively talking to you or you are telling a story and we get disconnected, know that I didn‚Äôt get bored and hang up. Something definitely happened on the worker‚Äôs line.

5. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call because they will record what I‚Äôm saying and it will be used against me later.‚Äù  From my knowledge, most privately and gov owned phone lines do not record phone calls.  Some that I am unaware of may have different standards but at least with the ones I‚Äôm aware of in my state and National level, we all make it very clear before your call that we are 100% anonymous.  We don‚Äôt record conversations or calls - I don‚Äôt even think our phones can do that.  Most times I take notes so that I can remember your name and specific hardships that you mention but we have shredders all around the office to discard those after we hang up.  You are also welcomed to not disclose your name if you have something really personal that you feel scared to let out.  If you are ever unsure about what is being recorded, please ask your phone worker and they will tell you what your organization allows. 

6. ‚ÄúMy problems are too big for them to handle‚Äù.  We have heard everything, trust me.  Everything from teens wanting to shoot up their schools to people who are having affairs to people calling us so that they can masterbate.  Nothing you say will surprise us or be too much for us to talk you through.  

I‚Äôm happy to answer any more questions in the comments if you have additional things that you are curious or unsure about.  I greatly recommend that you print out your local crisis line‚Äôs number and hang it on your fridge and enter it to your phone.  You have no idea how many calls we get from children/teens who got our number from their parents/friend‚Äôs parents either directly or indirectly.

If you are looking to find a hotline in your country, please refer to this link: https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html.  I recommend if you are in the United States that you look up a free, 24 hour hotline in your city or state (rather than the National hotline) as they will be more likely to have a smaller queue and can also give you strong resources within your zip code or area.  You can save this number for if you are having an emergency.  Never hesitate to call the National hotline either, though which can be found at that link.

Please call us.  We are ready and eager to help.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit:  concerning mandated reporting to 911 because many people are asking about it, every organization is different.  For mine, we are mandated reporters in cases where people are in active suicide or planning to hurt someone else.  We don‚Äôt call the police but we do call 911 and we have no control over what they decide is best in that situation (whether they should get cops involved or just emergency services.). However people saying that they feel suicidal is far from being in active suicide.  Even people that have access to suicidal methods, like if someone has a gun or pills in their home, we will not call unless they are actively trying to use them to kill themselves.  De-escalation is our main priority.

That being said, if we do need to call the 911, my call center and certain others have no way of knowing where the caller is since we are a 100% anonymous call center.  Some organizations may have trackers or can give your number away but we either have to convince people to call 911 themselves so that their location can be shared or we have to talk it out of them.

For example, I got a call one time from a lady who had just taken a bunch of sleeping pills and just wanted someone talk to while she died.  Through about 20 minutes of conversation I was able to get her to tell me where she was located and so emergency services were sent.  This is pretty rare and it only is required maybe once every couple of months.  Many people are sharing stories of themselves getting hurt by police and thrown into mental wards. I know that this is common and this is why my organization really doesn‚Äôt call 911 much.  Again, I cannot control if the 911 operator decides if the police should be involve or not and if this does happen if you get taken to a psych evaluation at a hospital.  My job in that moment is to save your life and remember, it‚Äôs not a choice - I‚Äôm a mandated reporter to 911 which means I‚Äôm required to call.  I try HARD AS HELL to prevent this from happening though but some situations are dire.  I really recommend asking whatever hotline you are calling what their mandated reporting requirements are or looking on their website under terms and conditions where it is laid out in writing.  

Most times if people are in very bad mental crisis that we cannot completely de escalate in a 30 min call, we can offer to send a mobile crisis team to your location. This involves sending two trained mental health professionals to an address that you give us and consent to them coming out to.  This is fairly common and probably happens around once every two hours on the line but it still not the most preferred conclusion.  We work very hard to help you on that phone anonymously and quickly.  I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to be turned away from getting help because they‚Äôre scared about what me as a phone worker is going to do.

If you are ever concerned about what is reported, being recorded, etc... please ask your phone worker.  We are legally required to be transparent to you.  Thank you!


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit #2:  here are some additional answers to questions I‚Äôve been getting in the comments:

1.  ‚ÄúShould I still call the line if I am just depressed and not suicidal?‚Äù  There are two different types of lines that I wish were spread around more clearly.  One is a suicide-only hotline.  These workers will only answer and respond to people who are actively suicidal or having suicide ideation right now.  Many of the negative stories in the comments have people saying that they were hung up on because they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúthat depressed‚Äù.  I can‚Äôt diminish your experience and I‚Äôm sorry that it happened.  In the future, if you know that you are not actively suicidal but still need someone to call, call a ‚Äúcrisis hotline‚Äù.  These are also trained volunteers and workers who deal with general crises.  Things like if you are depressed, having anxiety, want to vent, need to cry, need to get resources for drug addiction or domestic abuse etc... this is the place to call.  It‚Äôs also okay if you call the crisis line and later end up talking about suicidal thoughts, it happens more than you know.

2. ‚ÄúHow do I get a job as a phone worker or volunteer?‚Äù  The way I did it was that I went on my local hotline‚Äôs page by searching ones near me on google.  There was a tab that said volunteer and I filled out my email and a small application on there.  Within a week, a supervisor reached out to me and asked me to fill out more information involving sending them my resume, filling out a 4 page document on why I want to work there, and undergoing a background check.  Another week or so later, I got instructions on how to join an orientation where they told me more about the work and we could choose if we were still interested or not.  After a year of being a volunteer, I applied to a bachelors-level paid position at my hotline in which I oversee other volunteers if they have questions or concerns about calls.  My organization has bachelors and masters level positions.  I got my B.S. in physiology.

3. I want to say thank you to everyone who is sharing their bad experiences here as well as their good ones.  It‚Äôs important that organizations learn from people‚Äôs shitty experiences so that we can all get better as a whole.  I‚Äôve been suicidal and have attempted in my lifetime.  I‚Äôve called a suicide hotline and had a bad experience where I felt like I was wasting their time. I also called a couple times after that and was connected to the best people I have ever had the experience talking to.  They saved my life.  I applied to help because I want to make sure that everyone has a good, or atleast fair, experience when they are speaking to me as a phone worker.  

There are a couple of things that I recommend if you want to get the best chance at having good experience calling a phone line.  For one, I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, National phones lines have longer queues and they are likely rushed as phone workers.  They‚Äôre not a bad resource at all but if you are of sound mind, I recommend searching and saving a smaller hotline‚Äôs number around your area that deals with suicide or crisis that way you can have them in your phone when you need them.  Next, if you are concerned about if giving away your information will be tracked or reported... ASK.  Always ask so you never feel like you were duped into having the cops called on you or your address taken.  Ask if your call is recorded, ask if your number is recorded, and ask if you can even remain anonymous.  I don‚Äôt care what information you give me about yourself, I care about helping you get through tonight.  Many of this information can be found on your hotline‚Äôs website under the terms and conditions. Read through these if you don‚Äôt want to ask.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I have taken a break from this account indefinitely.  I don‚Äôt know what some of you want from me. I made an informational post based on MY experiences as a phone line worker and told you all of my knowledge on how to have the best chances at a good experience because often people have bad ones.  I‚Äôve called 911 on probably about 5 people in my whole career because they already took active measures to end their life or were planning on ending someone else‚Äôs soon.  They also knew that I was going to call and GAVE ME THEIR INFORMATION AND LOCATION because they realized that they needed in-person and immediate help that we cannot give them.  I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúswat them‚Äù or ‚Äúsend police to their door for no reason‚Äù.  I understand that this may be a rosey organization that I work at but the advice I gave to ask questions, call smaller hotlines, and read the terms and conditions still stand for any hotline you are calling.  Take a look at their website and understand their protocol. 

People have been messaging me that I should kill myself, that they hope I get cancer, that I‚Äôm the reason their father/mother died, I‚Äôm the reason they got sent a 20,000 dollar medical bill, I‚Äôm the reason they were trapped in a mental health facility for 7 months, I‚Äôm the reason they got beaten up by cops, etc... How can you say these things to another human being and then complain about how your own mental health was treated?  I‚Äôve been blamed for the actions of a huge line of decision-making people that I don‚Äôt even come in contact with at my job.  I‚Äôve been blamed for the actions of people at other organizations who I will never meet or talk to in my life.  I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation as stated in my post, and frankly, the comments attacking me have brought up a lot of that which is why I need to go.  I‚Äôm not upset that people have had bad experiences and are sharing them, that is inevitable and encouraged as I have also had bad experiences and we need to learn from them. I‚Äôm upset that people are messaging me really horrific things and attacking me.

I still want people to know that there are good organizations out there filled with people who want to help.  I know the comments here seem overwhelmingly negative but, often people who have had good or life saving experiences will not comment.  Not all hotlines are good but I hope, if you need it, you will still try to find one based on my advice above.  I wish I could bring all of you who have had bad experiences to my line and let you listen to the constant stream of people that we help for 8 hours a day, but I can‚Äôt and I realize that asking you to trust me after your personal, horrific experiences is too much to ask.  I hope that you all have found a therapist, psychiatrist, support group, or other healthcare professional or service and are working to heal from your mental health issues.

For example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. 

On the other hand, if you say ‚Äúoh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a huge pimple‚Äù, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it‚Äôs just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.

Also, if someone has shit/wet/bled somewhere, or something of that nature, discreetly tell them and offer help to get somewhere to fix themselves up.

Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. 

This also helps you compare what they‚Äôre willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don‚Äôt run the risk of under selling yourself! (If they‚Äôre expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they‚Äôre not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).

Edit to add: a bunch of commenters are making valid points. Do your research, know your worth and what the worth of the position is. If the company lowballs you, ask for more if you feel comfortable. Salaries are often part of a negotiation, and if you know you deserve more then advocate for it. Prove to them that you‚Äôre worth the investment, because if they‚Äôre not willing to pay you what you deserve (provided they can AFFORD to do so, some businesses just don‚Äôt have the funds to meet the same pay as another business) then you have to consider if they‚Äôre worth your time.

Second, I'm not discrediting the struggles, hard work and achievements of people who escaped poverty or wealthy/comfortable persons. You did well I congratulate you.

Just because you are stay/died poor it doesn't mean you are a failure remember that. You may have a lot of hidden achievements in that poverty line.

Last.
Bill Gates once said if you're born poor it's not your fault, but if you die poor it's your fault. 

Well this sounds motivational, but poverty is not a choice due to many factors(privilege, education, health, opportunity, proper guidance ) especially if you're in poverty line since birth. 

The poor are most likely the most hardworking people around. (3rd World Countries)..Think of our garbage collectors, factory workers, janitors, tricycle drivers, ice cream vendors etc. If they even attempted a day with these folks, the bourgeois would simply melt in the sun.  

They are simply fighting for the right to lead better lives ‚Äì with a roof over the head for starters. That‚Äôs an indication that nobody wants to be poor. We who are privileged need to be considerate.  It is irresponsible to blame the vulnerable for their mishaps in life.

So when i was 10 years old (13 now) my dad passed away of a stroke.

It was a rough 3 weeks and school was a total mess. I finished my year (year 6) and we decided to move to another city. So during year 7 I was still pretty messed up. My grades went from pretty good to really bad. I finished the year with 18 pts (pretty bad-ish for Switzerland) the next school year is a big year academically. You need to get 20 pts to get into VP (Voie Pr√©gymnasiale) basically sends you automatically to college/HS (idk lol) once you finish 11th grade. 

Anyways I realized that nothing that I ever did or say would bring my father back. So after grieving for what seemed like and eternity I decided to make him proud instead of failing.

Here‚Äôs how I did it.

After my worst year in school ever I went back in and started to put in some effort. I paid attention, I studied hard at home. When exams where approaching I studied like never before. (4+ hours every day) I got very good results from this. Finished the year with 21 /24 pts and got into VP.

I also had to deal with a new school and I had to try and make new friends which was not easy.

In summary:

In the beginning it will hurt. A lot. But overtime you will learn that it‚Äôs more important to shoot for the sky‚Äôs rather than fall to the ground. I kept my motivation and dignity to help myself and make my father proud.

In the end it paid off.

Make yourself proud and do what you think is best for you and do what you *think* would make a deceased loved one proud. This (in my case) worked for me but every person has their different way of grieving and their different way of going about things going forward. Also try your best to pull yourself up no matter how hard life throws you down. I know some people just can‚Äôt because of their own guilt or sorrow but at least try.

An old coworker told me an story about an accident that totaled his truck a while ago. He went through a greenlight, and a lady ran a red and t-boned him, totaling his truck. She paid off a witness at the bus stop and it was basically those two against his word. Fortunately, the bus was coming behind and caught the accident on it's cam. He tracked the bus down, and was able to get the footage from the bus and saved himself from jacked up premiums. 

Here's some advice on picking a dash cam, and towards the bottom there will be some helpful advice on installing a dash cam legally. You heard that, there's a legal and illegal way of installing a dash cam. I don't know everything there is to know about dash cams, but I'm sure at least a handful of people might benefit from this. If you don't have a dash cam, start looking for one after you're done reading.

**Picking a dash cam**

Here are some must have features when picking a dash cam: 

1. Find your price range- I'll be honest, right now isn't a great time to be spending money, but if you don't have a dash cam, you should seriously invest in one (when you can). That's right, this is an INVESTMENT. You're investing money into this in hopes that your insurance company won't jack your rates out the wazoo if you get in a car accident and the other driver pays off witnesses. There are some decent dash cams out there for $50, but I recommend spending at least $100 on one. I won't link or suggest a specific dash cam in order to protect the integrity of this post, but you get what you pay for, unless you get that $50-60 dash cam that I'm thinking of. There are some steals out there. Also, make sure that you get a good micro SD card as well. You can pick one up from Best Buy for less than $10. 

2. Automatic overlapping- Make sure it has ""loop"" recording so that it'll automatically replace old videos. If you have this, you'll just install it and it'll pretty much take care of itself until it breaks down, but checking to make sure that it's recording every time you put on your seatbelt isn't a bad idea (just do a quick glance at it to check that it's actively recording- usually indicates by a blinking red dot). Odds are, if you have loop recording, you'll have the ability to lock a video so it doesn't get overwritten as the card gets full. 

3. Automatic recording- Another must have for a dash cam is automatic on and off. Dash cams will usually plug into your cigarette lighter and most will turn on and off automatically based on whether the key is in the on/ off position. Don't get some cheapo one where you'll have to manually press a button to turn it on every time you get in your car... This is the equivalent of getting a major in Art History and a minor in computer science. 

4. Camera quality- Make sure that your dash cam has a reasonably clear camera. With dash cams, if you're able to make out the make and model of another car, you're good to go. As long as it's better than a gas station security camera, you're good to go for the most part. Unless you're able to shell out for something upwards of $150, then it probably won't be able to read the license plate of the car in front of you. I usually aim for 1080p or above just so that it'll look less like a pixelated mess on a computer screen in the event that you need to send the footage to somebody. You can always try to say enhance like they do on TV and watch as it magically unpixelates itself, but this has a lower chance of occurring than an entrepreneur major in college landing that sweet 6-digit salary job. 

5. Night time recording- This goes along with number 4, but don't buy a dash cam that suffers from astigmatism and can't record anything at night. With your headlights on, it'll blind the dash cam and everything that's seen in the light will just be washed out due to the contrast in light. Watch dash cam footage from both day and night. Amazon usually has users footage from that specific dash cam. Be the judge and decide whether or not you're okay with the quality, and if the footage is useful. If you're a cameraphile/ videophile, can you pretty please drop a comment describing what to look for in regards of camera specs?

6. Audio recording- What? You'll only capture your three-year-old screaming at the top of their lungs for more goldfish crackers. Wrong. This feature can be completely useful or utterly useless. If it records audio, then it's gonna be up to YOU to use it if you get into a vehicular incident. If you're able to read off the license plate of the car that swiped you, cut you off, and ran for it, then this will be valuable for tracking it down and confirming the identity of the driver if it comes to that. Like I said, most dash cams will have a tough time capturing license plates, but if you're able to read of the license plate of a car, you‚Äôll have an easy time identifying the car and driver that ran off.

These are just the ""must haves"" for me. If I'm missing anything that you feel is a must, then feel free to mention it below and I'll edit it in later. Here are some features that aren't necessary, but can definitely be nice to have. You can skip this section and go down to the next one

1. Temperature resistance- If you live somewhere sunny, this is a must for you. The inside of your car get hotter than Satan's asscrack on a sunny day, and you'll want a camera that can hold up against that temperature, so check what it's rated for. Edit, u/mattisstillhere mentioned dash cams with super capacitors. These super capacitors are able to hold onto electricity for a longer period of time, and do a lot better in hot conditions, so check these out if you live somewhere with a lot of sun.

2. Gravity sensor- This is just a sensor that looks for a sudden change in g-force. Cameras that have these advertised usually come with a lithium battery that can begin recording if it feels a sudden jolt while the car's off. I've personally never been able to validate this feature, so take this one with a grain of salt.

3. Wide angle view- A wide angle will capture more information at the cost of detail. Honestly this is more of a preference. I'd personally recommend a wide angle just because it'll capture more of what you‚Äôre seeing as opposed to just capturing what's directly in front of the lens. 

4. GPS/ Speed logger- Mine definitely doesn't have this feature. You'll only see it in higher end dash cams that cost upwards of $150. This might be useful if you're trying to prove that you weren't speeding, but once again, take this feature with a grain of salt. Save your money and be reasonable when picking a dash cam. Don't be that elitist that brags about their $350 dash cam. 

5. WiFi Data Transfer- Some dash cams advertise this feature. What it does is it allows you to connect your phone to the dash cam and be able to load videos on your phone with it. I've had little success with mine, but if you have fast cellular data, this might be useful during a police report (hopefully you won't ever have an accident that's serious enough for a police report), but once again, this feature has proved gimmicky for me, and transferring video files can take a few long minutes. 

6. 10ft cable- My dash cam came with a 10ft cable that's made the dash look a lot nicer. Most dash cams use a micro-usb cable, so it wouldn't be too hard to find a cable this size, but it's nice if your dash cam came with one. Use it correctly, more on that below. 

7. Rearview/ passenger cam- Some dash cams have cameras in both the front and the rear. This is definitely another useless feature unless you're a rideshare driver/ have an extremely clear view of the rear and happen to get rear ended. Even then, if you get rear ended, a regular dash cam and damage to your vehicle will be more than enough prove that you were stopped. 

**Advice for installing and using a Dash Cam**

I'm kind of happy that you've made it this far. Typing something other than college essays has been fun. I get to use my voice and type informally. I hope I've made this dull topic a little bit more fun to read. Honestly if I read my own post, I would've clicked out 500 words ago, so thank you for sticking around. I hope you install decide to install a dash cam if you haven't already. 

1. Read the manual and learn the buttons and what they do. Seriously, read the manuals for everything, your car, your fridge, everything. They all have valuable information that make using the product a lot easier and more intuitive. 

2. In some states, it's illegal for your dash cam (or anything for that matter) to be obstructing your view of the road. Make sure that the spot that you mount your dash cam is compliant with local laws. Don't let the other insurance company sucker punch you and use this as a reason to not pay out your claim.

3. If your dash cam came with an extra long cable, use it. Loop it around the passenger side of the vehicle and gently push it between where the windshield meets the roofliner, and run it under your glovebox. Use some clear tape or adhesive clips to (discreetly) secure it to your windshield. 

4. Buy a high quality micro SD card. I recommend the ones that are advertised as ""high endurance"", as these are meant to withstand the constant recording and deleting of large files. The size of the micro SD card doesn't really matter, but a 32GB once is what I recommend. It should hold about 2 hours (don't quote me on this) worth of video at 1080p. If you get in a wreck, your micro SD card will have the footage on it, and you can upload it into a computer to save that footage.

5. If you get into a car accident and you know you're at fault, you're not legally obligated to give footage to the other driver or a cop unless there's probable cause that you committed a crime, or if they have a search warrant. Once again, I‚Äôm writing this post from the US so check your country‚Äôs laws.

Edit: Added spacing for a few walls of text. Fixed some grammar stuff too. 

I hope you won't ever need to use the dash cam, but 77% of drivers will be in an accident during their lifetime. That's the majority of us, and the average driver will be involved in 3 to 4 accidents in their life. Get a dash cam. Cover your butt and capture other drivers doing stupid things. Make an idiot driver compilation. Hopefully you aren't driving anywhere non-essential during these times, but if you are, take care and be careful. Stay healthy, and drive safe.",41739,1391
r6031k,onelass,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/r6031k/,LifeProTips,LPT: Give your man some physical love and attention.,TRUE,"I realised this with my first boyfriend. Men are often starved of physical attention. It seems totally normal and socially accepted for girls to hug, caress, and kiss each other openly to show their friendship and love but men often cannot express their feelings in the same way.

Ladies and gents, give your guy the physical love he probably gives you. Touch his hair, hug him often, let him lay his head in your lap and just caress him. He deserves it and it's time to normalise men craving physical attention besides sex as well!

Edit because you people are absolutely right: bros, give your bros hugs, show and tell them you love them! Men are not machines and want to feel loved by their friends, family and SO.

Another Edit, because again, the comment section has offered great advice: obviously, not everyone is into physical love, platonic or otherwise. As always in life and love, consent is super important. Nobody can know what kind of history a person has and what kind of affection they enjoy!

Also: it's perfectly fine for men to be the little spoon or to be held affectionately. As someone in the comments stated: it doesn't make anyone less of a man to want to be held.

I called and simply  said something along the lines of ""even though it was my mistake to not check, it seems like a very high late fee, 2 dollars more than the late balance. Is there anything you can do for me?"" They said that the charges were applied automatically and how would i like to pay the 54 dollar balance?

Our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. We used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. After using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

Double bonus: Aim it at your SO and say you found something hot.

Edit: the LPT is be aware of the inflation rate when discussing raises with your boss. It is a strong negotiation point. One your boss can‚Äôt argue.


For those of you who have stayed with the same company through this pandemic or even just for the past year. End of year is fast approaching and it‚Äôs time for performance reviews &amp; raises.

The inflation rate this year is 5.6%. This is very important for those of you working in corporations that like to put out flat 2% raises or cap raises at 3-4%. Companies adjust their prices regularly to account for inflation and should adjust pay as well but it‚Äôs not in their interest to do so. Many will try to use excuses that ‚Äúbe happy you got a whole 3% that‚Äôs more than most/I even got‚Äù or even ‚Äúyou got a whole 4% RAISE. That‚Äôs huge.‚Äù

But the fact is 5.4% is just to maintain. If you get less than a 5.4% raise you are getting a pay CUT and if you get a 5.4% ‚Äúraise‚Äù they are just paying you the same as before. Your company may be struggling or needing to cut back and unable to give you more. But you do need to be aware that even if they are giving you a token ‚Äúraise‚Äù it is a pay cut.

The practice of giving/accepting 2% flat raises is why people find coworkers getting hired for more than them after a few years. It‚Äôs because you have been accepting pay cuts every year.

Edit: my apologies the data I looked at didn‚Äôt was a month out of date the inflation rate is actually 6.2% as of October.

This is for US. Every country has its own inflation rates and rules around it.

At its most basic, it means don't close any door you don't know how to open (unless a trusted grownup says it's ok) and don't climb inside anything that you aren't 100% sure you will be able to get out of from the inside (eg fridges, wardrobes etc). Know where your emergency exit is and how to use it. My kids learned how to open and unlock a car door as soon as they were old enough to understand they should only do that when the engine is off.

As they get older - I will teach them that this extends much wider than just locations and physical objects. It extends to religions (any religion you can join but not physically leave safely is a cult), relationships (my kids know - you always need a bank account in YOUR NAME ONLY with enough money to live on for at least a month; possessive relationships are a HUGE red flag; you NEVER stay in a relationship where someone even loosely implies they will kill you or themselves if you leave - having the conversation early in the relationship about how, if it doesn't work out, you will respectfully go your separate ways is really important), jobs (never sign a contract with a non-compete clause that would ruin you or prevent you from earning a living wage), etc.

The only thing in your life that (I would argue) shouldn't have an emergency exit is your relationship with your kids. As they grow, they obviously need to become independent, and Once they reach adulthood, they need to be able to pull away from you entirely if they choose to - but you need to be there as a safe and stable base for them if you possibly can be.

Not everyone likes dogs. Some are allergic. Some are deathly scared. Dogs can also react to sudden unexpected movements in surprising ways. Even if you lose your grip on a leash, it's easier to catch a leash than the unleashed dog. 

Keep your dog on a leash at all times in public. For everyone's safety, including your and other dogs.

For those confident in their dog's training, a leash is most likely to save your dog's life, not anyone else's. Your dog is more predictable to you but you have no idea how other dogs or people will react. With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.

A leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.

Exercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you. Go out to remote hiking trails. Running around in your local public park isn't nearly enough.

Some people will choose cheaper options because they're on a budget,TRUE,"I don't earn a lot of money and get major anxiety if anyone in my friendship group suggests going to a restaurant. Last week, I drank tap water and ordered cheap food (I'm veggie so my meals are usually cheaper anyway, but I did fancy a few beers) because I knew I only had a certain amount of money in my bank, while my friends ordered whatever they wanted, including multiple alcoholic drinks, spending nearly double what I was spending. When the bill came, nobody noticed my discomfort (I tried dropping hints!) and I ended up having to split the bill equally. To them it was probably a few quid, no biggie, (""it all balances out eventually""), but it absolutely ruined my evening as my card was declined in front of everyone

EDIT: I should have said, my close friends know that I'm skint (I talk about it openly), just maybe didn't realise how dire the situation was at that moment. But when it's a large group with lots of friends and their partners who you don't know very well it can be humiliating to draw attention to it in front of a table of people.

pegs3q,suddenly_ponies,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/pegs3q/,LifeProTips,LPT: Learn to accept that others don't care about some things as much as you do,TRUE,"I see a LOT of judgement in various subs:

* How can you not recycle? It's easy! Planet murderer!
* What do you mean you don't exercise regularly? It only takes like 30 minutes a day? Why are you so lazy?
* How can you eat meat? A vegan diet is an easy adjustment, you monster.

And so on.

The thing is, it doesn't matter how objectively awesome and beneficial a thing is, everyone has limited pools of time, money, interest, and willpower. It's great that you bike to work, champ! But try to remember it's not just ""10 minutes on a bike"" it's

* Getting a good bike and a place to store it
* Having good gear
* Learning the rules and regulations involved in using it in your area
* Having the energy to get up early enough for the extra time to prepare for a bike trip
* Having a shower or place to change at work (and having to actually change at work)
* Having a place to keep your bike
* Having to take the bike home no matter how late in the day, how the weather has changed in that time, or how exhausted and awful work was that day.

Basically, people vastly oversimplify what THEY like or do because the downsides either don't matter to them or they forgot they existed due to their lifestyle. As another example, I saw a former marine judging people for being ""lazy"" because they didn't regularly exercise. Meanwhile, I know people who are struggling to have enough energy to cook dinner instead of microwave foods at the end of the day due to kids, physical issues, emotional issues (depression for example). And what if someone just hates exercise while you personally don't mind that much (or love it) ? Doing a thing is much easier when you naturally enjoy it (or had some kind of life event that let you overcome your dislike or motivated you more than average to overcome it).

The point is that something that you can easily slot into YOUR lifestyle may not work so easily for someone else. Don't judge someone who's struggling with crippling debt and money management for not being charitable like you. Don't look down on someone who has computer trouble just because you like computers and it's easy for you to learn the ins and outs of computer security. Don't judge people when you don't know their limits and capabilities.

Bottom line, there are a million ""causes"" and banners people gather around, and judging people because they're not under your banner is missing the point that you're not under theirs either. And even if someone is under no banners, there might be a very valid reason for that too. Try not to judge people you don't know or understand.

Remember to show confidence, ask qstn. &amp; do not apologize",TRUE,"It's natural to take a few weeks to months to get accustomed to a new role or job. Work bullies might prey in these initial weeks. They will try to tarnish your image in the team and destroy your self-esteem to enable them in exploiting you. It is also more common for senior co-workers who exploit their positions of power to show such behavior.

How to tackle this:

1. Best way is to show confidence when you are sensing such a behavior. DO NOT APOLOGIZE unnecessarily. Instead try saying ""Oh so this is how it's done, no one told me this. Thanks for highlighting it, is there anything I should keep in mind?
2. Ask questions from start, be vocal. Do not let the bully think they can talk over you and shut you down.
3. These are hard things to do, some bullies are too manipulative and will corner you down. Seek mentors/colleagues at work who believe in you and build you up.

If you are someone actively being bullied:-

1. I am so sorry you are going through this. It is really hard when someone exploits you at your weakest.
2. Seek out your friends and tell them what is happening and how you feel. Sharing helps.
3. You might have to work on building your confidence for long term, but the best immediate option is to start over or a new job. Such toxic work cultures are not worth your time. If you are still stuck there and cannot because of monetary or other reasons, remember to remind yourself of your achievements and how far you have come, do not let these bullies make a dent on your self-worth, because that's what they prey upon.

There are people out there who are proud of you seek them. But the proudest has to be you :)

**Edit1**. I see a lot of people commenting how this is a school thing and are surprised by the term work bully. I know bullying is a big topic in schools in USA, but anyone can turn into a bully. It's the sudden access to a position of power that makes them a bully and corrupts their basic decision making skills. **Example**: A Supreme leader of a country in asia, just cause he is a president he believes that whatever thought that comes to his mind is truth by the god, but anyone can be a president(at least a lot of people) it does not make you special, or messiah of god himself and you should not exploit this position of power. I hope these insights helps you in understand this issue better.

EDIT:  ""IV tPA should be administered to all eligible acute stroke patients within 3 hours of last known normal and to a more selective group of eligible acute stroke patients (based on ECASS III exclusion criteria) within 4.5 hours of last known normal. Centers should attempt to achieve door-to-needle times of &lt;60 minutes in ‚â•50% of stroke patients treated with IV tPA.""

EDIT:  Getting messages saying it is bad advice to advise not to call 911.  Let me be clear, you should call 911 for their advice and on which hospital you should go to, and if the person can't walk, obviously they need an ambulance.  But in my specific case, my parents live in the country so we would have been waiting AT LEAST 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, precious time to assess and load my dad into the ambulance, and then drive back into the city. In my case, it made sense to just load up and go, but we probably should have had 911 on the line while we were driving.

Prologue:  I worked at a hospital that is a stroke center from 2010-2014 as a grunt.  Dad is a retired doctor.

I went to my parent's early on Christmas Eve 2020, was helping dad put heavy stuff in the attic.  Afterward, he said he needed to vacuum but could not say the word ""vacuum"", and then said ""am I having a stroke?""   I thought, ""fuck"".  Then he said vacuum, and walked to his bedroom, and I hoped it was just a brain fart and he was fine.  Nope, he comes into living room and sits down in chair, and he can't speak.  At all.  He points to his mouth. No facial drooping.  I later learned he meant he was drooling.  I thought, ""fuck, fuck, fuck"".  I knew he was having a stroke.  Mom walked by, I said ""dad is having a stroke"".  She said ""no no no,"", and gave him an aspirin.  I said we can't wait,  we gotta go to the hospital now.  Got dad into the car and had mom drive to the stroke hospital I used to work at, in about 30ish minutes from onset of stroke.  They gave him the TPA protocal.  They said he most likely had the stroke due to him being in Atrial Fibrillation, which fired off a clot to his head.  He went up to the ICU that night, Christmas Eve.  He was able to speak that night.  The next day, Christmas Day, even better.  He was released on 12.26.20, able to speak very understandably with only a slight defect that should go away, because the neurologist said he should recover fully.    
    

If they can walk, don't wait on an ambulance, throw them in a vehicle and get them to a major hospital ASAP.  It would probably have been at least an hour longer wait if we had waited on an ambulance.  Ideally, know what your local medical facilities are known for (heart, stroke/neurological, children, etc) and where they are so you can make an educated choice about which you should drive to.

-----

EDIT 1:  Woke up so grateful to see that many people are seeing this info.  My dad told me once he was able, ""you saved my ass"", so hopefully this info will allow you save someone else's ass.    

EDIT 2:  Per u/SquiddlyGiggly, giving aspirin is a no-no because it can make the stroke worse.  Good to know, I'll pass that info along.  I think my mom gave him aspirin because my dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64 and she probably thought he might be having a heart attack and just couldn't speak due to being out of breath.  Which leads me to...    

EDIT 3:  My dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64.  He said his blood pressure has been fine even without medications, so he stopped taking his medications for his heart awhile ago.  And apparently he was right about not having heart blockages or high blood pressure, but those aren't the only heart worries it seems.  I thought he was still getting checkups, but I learned after this that he has been refusing to go see his doctor.  If he had, perhaps they would have caught the Atrial Fibrillation (A Fib) and treated it before this happened.  My mom thinks this was a blessing because hopefully it will be a wake up call for him to take ongoing checkups seriously.    
    

So one more thing to add to this LifeProTip, show your family members this story and the importance of getting checked out and addressing issues before they become worse.  Dad said another stroke patient came in while he was there, and the guy was basically a vegetable.  Remind family that they may be ready to die, but are they ready to live with permanent handicaps like not being able to speak or use half their body.    

EDIT 4:  I just remembered a stroke patient I had when I worked at the hospital.  Guy was late 40s, maybe early 50s, looked like he was in great shape (thin body type) and like he worked a manual job.  He was laying there with his eyes closed and not able to speak, just grunt.  I ""think"" that was his 2nd or 3rd stroke, progressively getting worse I think.  Anyway, my point is, do not judge their age or outer appearance as to whether they can have a stroke.

So instead of immediately offering solutions, try acknowledging the person's feelings and the legitimacy of the problem they're facing.

For example, instead of...

* ""Why don't you try to do...""
* ""What have you done to fix it?""
* ""How can I make it better?""

Try using...

* ""Wow, that does sound really tough.""
* ""I can't imagine how hard that must be for you.""
* ""I would absolutely feel sad/angry/frustrated too...""

If you're not sure what someone needs, asking can be as simple as ""That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help or do you just want to talk about it?""

She just came to me and told me about how her AP English teacher tried to pull a fast one on the entire class.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had it happen to me before as well in my bachelors.

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher changes the syllabus to either add new rules or claim there was leniancy options that students didn't take advantage of. Most of the time it's harmless but sometimes it's catastrophic to people's grades.

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, teacher tried to act like there was a requirement people weren't meeting for their reports. Which was not in the original syllabus upload.

&amp;#x200B;

In my sister's case, the english teacher was giving nobody more than an 80% on their weekly essays. So when a bunch of students complained and brought their parents, he modified the syllabus to act like he always gave them the option to come in after school and re-write the essays but they never took advantage of it. One of my sister's friends was crying because her mom, a teacher at that school, was mad at her for not going in for the make-up after school.

When confronted about this not being in the original syllabus, he acted like it was always there. My sister of course had the original copy downloaded and handled it like a boss! Now people get to make up their missed points and backdate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry to all good teachers out there but not all teachers are as ethical as we'd like to think.

The goal of doing this is not to catch a teacher in their lie, the reasons to make a folder dedicated for a class from day 1 and keeping copies of everything locally are too many to list, they include taking ownership, having records, making it easy for yourself, learning to be organized, having external organization, overcoming lack of organization in an LMS, helping you study offline, reducing steps needed to access something, annotating PDFs, and many more.

My good friend D, a lesbian, wanted to become an electrician but was worried about being accepted. It took her about two days to realize she was more than welcome and could live that dream.

Edit 2: this thing blew up. So, my Venmo is on my profile. If you want to help finance this, I'll take it. I'm not asking for donations and I don't expect anyone to help. But I have had a lot of messages asking for it and my phone might melt soon. I hope this slows the tide.

A great way to fight it is by volunteering and volunteering is very simple.,TRUE,"It's a win-win situation.  In my personal experience my own problems seem to sort themselves out when I start to help other people with theirs.  Get in the holiday spirit and volunteer!

A very simple example would be a service like meals on wheels, it can be as easy as picking up food and dropping it off to someone that needs it.  If you don't have a car they also need help prepping food.  Their info is readily available online.

Animal shelters always need volunteers to walk and wash dogs amongst other things.  Be careful with this one, you will be tempted to adopt!

Perhaps you are skilled in a trade.  Find a lucky individual to offer your services to for free.

There are endless ways.  Make cookies for your work.  Shovel your neighbors driveway.  Watch your friends kids for free.

Things to expect for 1st timers:

It's work!  It won't necessarily be fun.  You will need to sacrifice to make it happen, whether that's time, money, both, or simply canceling/skipping out on something else.  You WILL feel good about it and if you are someone that is struggling with depression it can help you realize you are a good person that deserves to feel good about yourself!

This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:

The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.

Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.

If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified ""even in the middle of the night"". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.

EDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:

This is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. 

The ""Do not, in any case"" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple ""sorry for your loss"". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.

The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how ""anything"" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up. I was just making a point.",35871,1373

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

I‚Äôve posted/commented on other subs about this struggle before. I realized many others related. When I was younger I was very passionate about, well, everything. In middle school I was already starting full-fledged businesses, in highschool I was teaching myself robotics + programming. Always wanted to work at startups, always wanted to be a part of something. But the key thing is: I would frown upon those that had no passion in life. I‚Äôd use that quote over and over again about most men dying at 25 but being buried at 75. I could not wrap my head around someone wanting a peaceful life where they just want to settle down and enjoy themselves. I considered it an *early death*.

Fast forward a few years, and that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted. My passion passed and I was prioritizing stability above all else. And I hated myself for it. I searched for ways to get back to my super motivated and passionate self. I didn‚Äôt want to become that adult I swore I would never become. Some people told me it may be a mental illness, and it can be in your own situation, but that never ended up being the issue. Others said to just get my shit together and get disciplined. Which I did do, but I really just improved my health/lifestyle. I never got back to that feeling where it felt like I wanted success more than anything. Where it felt like I was breathing fire.

So, to sum it up, it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that it‚Äôs okay to prioritize stability as you get older. It‚Äôs a part of growing up. Your priorities will change. I mean, if you‚Äôre able to pull constant overnighters and run your own business at 35? That‚Äôs great, good for you. But for most of us, that won‚Äôt last forever. And that‚Äôs okay. Or maybe it‚Äôs the opposite case for you, where you currently want to be a single CEO or something while your past self wanted a nice big family. That‚Äôs okay too. Your past self won‚Äôt be disappointed in you, because your past self is a construct you‚Äôve made up in your mind. There‚Äôs most likely no way to fully recreate your past mindset. Right now, you are your present self. And all that matters is what your present self prioritizes and wants in their life.

Then I wait. As time goes on, people have a tendency to mention things they really like or want. Whenever that happens, I just quietly add to the list. 

Watching TV and your girlfriend casually ways she really likes the robe that some woman on screen is wearing? Added to the list. Walking through Hallmark with my mom and she says she really likes these small glass statues l? List.

Now it's [non-denominational winter holiday] and while everyone else is scrambling for a present, I can rest easy because I can just consult the list and get everyone something that they will both love and never see coming.

I've learned that the real power of the list comes after it has accumulated entries. Once this happens you can combine gift ideas in a way that the other person could never expect. While going through an art mueseum 8 months ago with my (now ex) girlfriend, she casually mentions that she really likes this painting. I look at the title and author, take a picture, and add it to the list. She also really likes jigsaw puzzles. Once I noticed that I added it to the list. For her last birthday I was looking through the list to see if I could think of anything and I decided to get her a custom jigsaw puzzle of this one painting that she loved and has since never seen again. She was stoked when she opened it and it's been her favorite puzzle since (even after the breakup).

I went from being a terrible gift giver to being incredible at it. People are genuinely excited to recoece a gift from me now. Seeing their face light up every time their birthday or a holiday comes around makes this a huge payoff for basically zero effort.",34763,579

Having these kinds of friendships are a normal part of becoming an adult.,TRUE,"I‚Äôve noticed a trend online where people (mainly younger people) talk about having a ‚Äòlow maintenance‚Äô best friend. Essentially it‚Äôs a friend who you don‚Äôt see or talk to for months - but when you do see them, it‚Äôs like no time has passed at all. You both give each other an extensive update of everything that has happened in your lives and just have an overall spectacular time. You promise each other you‚Äôre definitely going to meet up more often but ultimately you never do, and the cycle continues. 

When I see posts talking about this situation, it‚Äôs usually presented in a sad, guilty and self-deprecating sort of way. 

I think the routine of school or college can trick us into thinking that we need to be in contact with our friends every day for our relationships to stay alive. For those of us who have grown up with social media, perhaps we feel extra guilt because we *know* that keeping up with a friend can be as easy as sending them a meme, or reacting to an Instagram story every now and then.

I live alone, my family lives out-of-state, and being that I'm in my 30s, all of my friends have jobs during the week and I'm not going to call and bother any of them at 6am to go get stuff for me at the grocery store. So I ended up mustering as much strength as I could and going to Kroger to get stuff like ginger ale, pedialyte, chicken soup, saltines, and popsicles. It was not one of my best moments.

I couldn't help think how it would have been so much more convenient if I had some sort of pre-prepared ""sick kit"" containing these types of items. I was always taught to keep medicines around in my first aid kit like Tylenol, pepto bismol, Vicks vapo rub, cough drops etc. - general medicines you need for when you're sick but not ""go to the doctor"" sick. However, this kind of stuff is really only half of what I needed today. I needed liquids to drink that would be easy on my stomach (and replenish what I was losing through... things that happen in the bathroom when you're sick) and bland foods to keep up my strength without making me sicker.  I didn't really have anything on hand, because these aren't items I consume regularly. I just don't get sick very often.

It would have been nice to be able to just get out my kit and have everything I went to the store for today, since these are pretty common types of items that I like to have whenever I have any sort of general cold/flu/bug. You can make your own list of preferred items, but here's what I'm going to stock for future use:

Saltine crackers
Pedialyte/Gatorade
Plain rice cereal (chex, Rice Krispies, etc.)
Flavor-ice style popsicles that can be stored at room temp and popped into the freezer when needed
Ginger ale
Chicken noodle soup
Applesauce

Even if you don't live alone, a kit like this could come in handy. I know that there are delivery services that exist now too, but you will pay a premium for the products and you still have to wait for delivery. Pre-stocking a kit allows you to be picky about what you will pay, and not everyone lives where delivery is available anyway.

One last note, obviously most of this stuff is perishable, so keep your kit somewhere that you won't forget about it until it's too late.
 
EDIT - wow guys, this has been fun! I posted this and passed out for a while and woke up to a ton of fun comments and other great suggestions. A couple of quick notes...

1) Yes, as many people have pointed out (and as I did too) there are grocery delivery services that exist like Amazon prime now. I think this is still a good tip for many reasons. First of all, like I already said, you will pay premium prices for products through most delivery services, and many of them have minimum purchase limits and/or delivery fees. And then there's the fact that you have to wait for the delivery. Also there are ""business hours"" for most of these services, so if you wake up puking in the middle of the night, you'll have to wait until they're open. Lastly many people still don't live where these services are available.

2) The main criticism I'm hearing is something along the lines of, ""Don't you already keep stuff like this around the house? I mean obviously any responsible adult would stock these items."" Well, here's the thing, not everyone thinks to stock foods they almost never eat/drink. Congratulations if you regularly buy pedialyte and canned chicken noodle soup, but a lot of people wouldn't think to buy these items normally.

It said I had a certain amount of time to pay up, and that even if I went to the police there was no way the email could be traced. It even went so far as to say there was a specific pixel in the email showing that I had read it. 

Thankfully my boyfriend was with me and quick to notice it had to be a scam since I don‚Äôt even have Facebook.

I am not trying to tell people nursing staff doesn't know how to get around in a hospital, they do in fact.

But in my experience, when patients are lost and are looking for directions, for entirely different departments within a hospital, some staff have never left their department so their spatial knowledge about the area could be limited.

Housekeeping staff, on the other hand, will typically have visited every part of the hospital on a weekly basis, so they could know exactly where you need to go and give you accurate directions promptly, hell I'd even bring you myself there.

kk7ueu,Demonthrall22,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kk7ueu/,LifeProTips,LPT: Exercise when you don't want to,TRUE,"As a 37 year old, I look back to the single most valuable lesson I have learned in life. It was told to me in passing by an older gentleman in a community center gym locker room when I was in my twenties, about 10-15 years ago. 

I entered the locker room to change before working out and noticed he was just getting ready to leave. We made eye contact, I smiled, and asked ""How heavy are they today?"" A simple gesture of friendliness.

He smiled and said, ""Only the first couple. Motion before emotion."" 

He sort of sang it to me. Motion before emotion... Over the next decade, this attitude became capitalized, highlighted and underlined in my mindset.

Exercise is easy to avoid in life. Especially to a newbie, the thought of it is very unpleasant, intimidating and easy to ignore. 

Exercise however is an incredibly powerful tool in handling depression, stress and anxiety that life can deal you. I cannot overstate this. With regular exercise your mood improves, your ability to handle stress increases dramatically and your body performs with greater efficiency. You sleep better, you heal faster, you just feel good more often.

The ability to exercise regularly throughout the rest of your days will dictate both the quality and quantity of the life you lead.

Motion before Emotion. 

Our bodies have this beautiful built in mechanism to help us endure physical effort. When we engage in exercise, after only a few minutes our brain starts releasing feel good chemicals(endorphins) to help us cope with the effort. Our body literally comes preloaded with special drugs made to help us feel good during strenuous movement our bodies!

Motion before Emotion. Therein lies the secret key to making it happen. 

Sometimes the last thing we want to do when we are depressed or troubled is to get up and exercise. The thought is almost painful. But you must start moving before you will feel better! However awkward and foreign it feels. Your body will not release the endorphins until you get moving, but release they will! Like clockwork. You must move your body and raise your heart rate to access those chemicals which release stress, make you feel happier and desire to exercise longer.

You will feel better when you start moving, when your heart rate increases. If you are feeling depressed, anxious, stressed or are having trouble sorting through your thoughts- get up, get moving! Get out that door, go for a walk, hop on your bike, or in your car to head to the gym.

You must provide the spark. Starting to exercise is up to you. Your body has a built in fuel system to carry you through the rest. Exercising regularly will reward you in both the short and long term.

Motion before emotion!

Don't take a job as a X Intern at a company that doesn't have anyone who can do X.",TRUE,"Interning should be a process of learning a craft while you help to contribute to the overall institutional goals. 

If a company is advertising for an intern position, but doesn't have anyone who does that job, then they are probably just trying to pay someone less for a job that they want someone to be able to do. Traditionally, these are jobs that young people are adept at, but older people may not have the skills to perform. 

For example, they probably need/want a Social Media Manager, not a Social Media Intern, but they want to pay less, hence the title. If you interview for a position like this, ask who at the company you will be learning from. If they don't have someone senior in the role, they may be willing to offer a mentor in other valuable skills - a senior marketing manager, for example. 

Consider negotiating a title that reflects what you will be learning, not just what you will be contributing. This will help you develop your resume and, well, hopefully learn new skills. Also consider negotiating a title change and salary adjustment to reflect that title. ""It seems that you don't have anyone at the company in a position to mentor a Social Media Intern and that what you really need is a Social Media Manager. I'm happy to take that role, at the junior level, and prove my worth to the company."" 

Really take a look at the learning on offer and what it's worth to you - if they're paying you $20k less a year, then your mentorship better be up to that value. You can save yourself a lot of wasted time and money by avoiding this ""Intern Trap"".

EDIT: To be clear, some internships are genuine where you trade your work for real on the job learning (and a small paycheque). These should have someone on staff who is responsible to the intern - an actual mentor - or there should be a clear trade of skills/experience for your work and time. These are not the ""Intern Traps"" I intended to warn about. Nor am I talking about internships or practicums related to an educational course of study.

I'm talking to job seekers looking for a job who might be undervaluing their skills, potentially negotiating with a company that is trying to take advantage of the applicant.  

In Canada, where I'm from, unpaid internships are (now) illegal, though were prevalent early in my career. These privilege people who have enough resources and support to be able to give their time and labour away without financial compensation and disadvantage people who can't afford to work for free because they have bills to pay.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the Helpful awards and the Silver! My first ever and I appreciate it!

EDIT 3: A lot of people are reading this post as anti-internship. It is not intended to be! I am very pro-internship. This is a tip to ask in the interview to determine if what is on offer is, indeed, an internship or if it is a lowball play for your skills and labour. Just know what you are getting into by asking about the mentorship, training, and skills that they plan for you to learn. If they don't have a plan, they *might* be exploitative. If you had a great internship experience, great! Lucky you! And thanks for sharing these experiences.

Howdy!

We did this for my 96 year old grandmother, since we haven't been able to visit her.  We had to come up with a solution that would work for her, even though she's not in a position to learn any technology at the moment.

I bought an inexpensive tablet with a cellular internet connection from Verizon, and set it up so that it would automatically accept video calls over Skype from me and the rest of my family (the Skype app has a setting for that). Then I sanitized it, and dropped it off for her.

When we call, we're immediately connected. My grandmother doesn't need to tap or touch anything to answer the call. She just needs to keep the tablet plugged into its charger in a place where she can hear our voices when we call.

There was also no need to set the tablet up on WiFi, since it uses a cellular connection. For her, it worked ""out of the box.""  The tablet's cellular connection only costs us $10/month extra on our existing phone family plan.

My grandmother has really enjoyed it. üôÇ

For example, instead of thinking 'I'm worried because I'm sick, and I won't be able to focus in that very important class tomorrow, and then I will fall behind, etc etc' think like 'If I am unable to focus in the lecture tomorrow I will ask X for the notes and go over them when I feel better' to stop it right there.

I was clueless and had no idea what was about to happen. Thank god I discussed this with my friends, one of which was smart enough to explain to me what was really going on. I stopped going to the meetings and was harassed by the guy, and the girl who asked me to come to this meeting.

I was shocked when I told my mom what had happened and she explained something similar had happened to her when she was younger. I felt for a moment my parents had failed me. 

I won‚Äôt let my future children leave the house without telling them this story and how to spot the warning signs!

Some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.",TRUE,"This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say &amp; do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think ""how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around"".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. 

I'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds.

fl8lms,Slartibradfast,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fl8lms/,LifeProTips,LPT Advice on managing extended periods away from the World,TRUE,"I was a submariner for 6 years with multiple deployments of 6 months and other extended underways of multiple months with short in-port stints in between. In that time I had to develop coping strategies for dealing with the isolation and loss of social contact with the outside World.

Here's what I learned:

1) Hold fast to whatever is waiting for you on the other side. It doesn't matter it feels foolish, or whether there is certainty of it happening exactly as you plan in the end. Hope can deliver us from the darkest of days.

2) Be goofy AF. Crack jokes. Be odd. Let your mind wander when it needs to. You need to let that pent up energy out often. Channel it into whatever creative nonsense you can think of.

3) Food is fuel. Eat what you need, but ration the good stuff. You'll need the good rewarding pick-me-ups spaced out in time.

4) Make a time-keeping record / log. Put all your thoughts, poems, songs, rants, etc in it. Bonus if you can collaborate on it with others.

5) Share your thoughts with others and commiserate often. We are all in the suck, and it doesn't matter how much worse anyone has it. Your feelings are valid, and need acknowledgement.

6) Write letters to loved ones, and record videos for them to watch (and facetime now that that tech is available). I always felt special when someone went to the trouble of making something like that for me, and letting me know they care. And I felt good making them too.

7) Have a project. Something long term that you have to work on gradually. Education, making, hobby, art, etc.

8) Make and share playlists for your various moods, and embrace the moods you feel fully. Get all the joy, rage, pain, and everything out. Scream if you need to. Don't worry about looking crazy, because the World is crazy, and we are a reflection of it.

9) Get to know people that you would never talk to in your normal routine. They will change your life.

10) Reward your accomplishments. Because you are a survivor, thrill hunter, a champion, and a badass.

11) Be a dick as little as possible, and share whatever you can.",33098,808

Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made. 

Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. 

EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google ""tinnitus definition"" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

""[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public ‚Äî over 50 million Americans ‚Äî experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"" 

Stay safe everyone. 

EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! 

As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. 

Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~""Etymotic""~~(just search for ""earplugs that don't muffle sound"") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said ""Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed."" However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. 

Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just ""disappears"". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.

TL:DR; when you‚Äôre a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren‚Äôt comfortable engaging the aggressor. 

At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don‚Äôt normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier‚Äôs curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don‚Äôt have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.

As a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


So i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. My friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


My mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.


Edit: wow, didn't expect this response, also apparently this is very common in IT sector (but applies to pretty much all industry), and i am in the IT sector :/ - still feels so unfair.

I'm suggesting getting groceries delivered to your door so that you don't go out and infect anyone, if you don't have this option please opt for curbside pickup and avoid going in to stores or anywhere you could infect people. And I'm suggesting doing it before you show symptoms because there is a very real possibility that once you start to exhibit symptoms then you will be stuck in bed or too exhausted to do anything.

Learning techniques like ‚ÄúMemory Palaces‚Äù will let you learn anything FAR faster,TRUE,"The important concepts with the best educational resources i've ever found on memory techniques:

**(1) Spaced repetition -** this technique lets you remember things by systematically reminding you of the information over time in a spread-out way optimised for your long-term memory.  Only 5 mins a day spent on this technique can have a massive impact on your memory. Its effectiveness grows exponentially over time the more you use it aswell so it quickly starts to have a massive impact on your life.

**(2) Memory palaces / Method of Loci -** our memory is much better at remembering images &amp; locations than things like concepts and text. Memory palaces take advantage of this by turning what you want to learn into an image &amp; location. You practice imagining a house you know well and then in your mind place new pieces of information in different parts of the house. It takes a lot of effort to build your memory palace to begin with but once you have it it will help you remember things efficiently for your whole life.

**(3) Mnemonics -** these are basically tricks that let you remember things more easily by associating them with different things.  The 9 types of mnemonics e.g. making a rhyme out of something you want to remember e.g. linking together different things you want to remember into a story

8szqi8,Edenspawn,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8szqi8/,LifeProTips,LPT: Never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.,TRUE,"It may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

Edit: Couple of things that have come up

1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.

Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is ""Seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.

1-star reviews are often the result of a mistake or incident that's not common overall.

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

Edit: You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ‚âà 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

I don't judge because we learn best by making mistakes but if I had a dollar for every plant that died because it wasn't allowed to properly acclimate before people started messing with it, I'd be able to buy a variegated banana plant. The thing about plants is that, in nature, they don't really move and their environment are somewhat consistent and predictable. When you move a plant from point A to point B (e.g. from Lowe's to your kitchen), this is a huge shock to the plant and it needs time to recover. Repotting is also a huge shock and, if you don't let the plant recover from being moved first, it's *really* not going to like this and probably drop leaves, turn yellow, and look really sad/die. If you hold your horses and wait a week or two, you'll have a much higher chance of having a positive outcome (some plants are just wimps and will die even if you do everything right). 

Personally I've killed a lot of plants by watering them right after I get home because they had been overwatered at the garden center and then I pushed them over the edge. I've started letting the soil really dry out and I've had significantly fewer fatalities. Some people also want to immediately fertilizer their plants after they get home. In my unprofessional opinion, this is like taking a multivitamin because you have a cold and is a waste of fertilizer. You also run the risk of over watering.

Unfortunately, that‚Äôs what happened to me. A close friend of mine unexpectedly died. I was traveling at the time and a friend posted to social media the second that he found out. I was scrolling through my phone sitting on a subway when I read the post. I should have been told through a phone call or at least something more personal. Facebook is the last place I want to find that information out - especially for a close friend.

To be clear, I‚Äôm not arguing that you shouldn‚Äôt post condolences or fond memories at all. All I‚Äôm saying is wait at least a day so people close to the deceased can properly be notified.

Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre cool because you were the first to break the bad news to all of your Facebook friends. Be respectful of the people around you that could be about to go through a difficult time.

I can‚Äôt believe how many people this has happened to. To all of you who found out that a loved one passed in this way, I‚Äôm truly sorry. It‚Äôs really impersonal and is a horrible start to the grieving process.

I think a great addition from u/illthinkofonel8er is ‚ÄúNot just death, births, engagement, weddings, pregnancies, anything big‚Äù. A good rule of thumb is to let the main people involved give the news and share your thoughts after. Again, I would argue in the case of deaths, don‚Äôt share on social media for 24-48 hours even if you are one of the main people close to the deceased. Let it go through the correct, personal channels before posting.

To the people that say it‚Äôs not a big deal, it‚Äôs a valid opinion. The main thing is that the person died and more people know about it now. However - maybe I‚Äôm old fashioned, but I would prefer a call or something more personal if it‚Äôs someone close. I‚Äôd like to talk it over with someone I care about and understand the full extent of the situation.

To all of you who say ‚Äúdelete Facebook and never worry about it again‚Äù, you‚Äôre not wrong. For a lot of people, social media is very toxic. For some (me included), it‚Äôs still a way of getting small updates from friends that you are no longer close with. There are events and deaths that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have known about if it wasn‚Äôt for social media and I‚Äôm glad I found out though Facebook rather then not finding out at all. That being said, it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference to me if I would have found out those things a couple days later.

To all of you who say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt post anything‚Äù, you‚Äôre also not wrong. People make these posts about themselves to just get attention. It‚Äôs really not a good look in my opinion. I will say that there is a time to make a thoughtful post or share some old pictures if you feel that‚Äôs necessary. There‚Äôs definitely something cathartic about people that you genuinely care about giving support and knowing that you‚Äôre not going through something alone.

EDIT: I have tried to respond to those asking for further advice and hope I didn‚Äôt miss anyone.

There will be yet another massive change when you go back to your old routine, perhaps back to work on a daily basis, and it‚Äôs important to consider all the affects this could have on your puppy and their progress.
I also recommend playing brain games with your dog during isolation, and also in general‚Äî look them up, they‚Äôre fun and rewarding. My dog likes hide and seek and anything involving treat rewards haha. 
Most vets (and commenters here) also recommend crate training. This is of course ideal, and better than going to another room and letting your dog claw at the door, but right now not everyone has access to a crate so just use best judgement and speak to your vet when possible.

It will be noticeable if there is a problem, and this is for asphalt not metal**

Your neighbors homes will/should have snow spread out across the roof. A roof on a house with bad insulation will have dry spots without snow or no snow at all on the roof. Another way to tell is if you have an unusual amount of icicles. 

Fixing/trying to fix the problem can be expensive but it is worth it if you can afford it. You are able to do sections at a time if you would rather, but if you do it by yourself you should wear breathing masks so that you don't breathe in the dust in the attic. You should do this especially if your house was built before 1990 and hasn't had any improvements done on the insulation. I really think it's worth it to do the upgrades in the long run. 

Edit: **If you live in an area that doesn't snow** here is my idea (this is also just a guess) You could try getting a temperature of your attic floor and the temperature of your ceiling under your attic and see if there is a major difference on a very hot day when the inside of your house is cool.

I used to be disorganized and messy but simply adhering to a principle of picking up two things every time I enter a room has completely changed me. Picking up two things adds up quick and if you stick to this your house will be fully clean in no time.

This taught me a valuable lesson that being clean is not about waiting until everything gets messy to clean it, its about living a clean lifestyle. I now understand how clean people are clean, they simply are literally always cleaning. The best way to be clean and organized is to incorporate cleaning into your lifestyle. There's no need to take time away from your day to clean simply adhere to this rule and you will quickly see how easy it is to incorporate cleaning into your daily lifestyle.

Enter my room, pick up two pieces of clothes. Enter my kitchen, put away a couple dry dishes. Leave my car and take two pieces of trash with me. No overwhelming three hour cleans just an incredibly simple and easy commitment. I don't even think about it anymore. Once I run out of things to clean I find myself organizing my closet, kitchen, going out of my way to improve my life in little ways.

‚Äî‚Äî-

This has been a long process of realization for myself, and I figured it could help someone else.

If there is ANYTHING under the sun which you tend to forget about, set an alarm, reminder, or calendar alert for it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the weekly meeting, your significant other‚Äôs (or pet‚Äôs) birthday, or if it‚Äôs the expiration date for the milk you bought.

To begin with, it might clutter your calendar or wherever you put reminders, but it could potentially help you remember better in the long run because you are taking an active step towards remembering and being proactive instead of reactive. It‚Äôll also help you be more proactive in reducing possible waste which will save you money.

For perishables like milk, tofu, meat, cottage cheese or anything else you can eat, set a reminder a week or a few days before the expiration date. Then, it‚Äôll be more likely that you can actually manage to use the perishable food or, possibly, it might at least give you time to offer someone else the food you know you just won‚Äôt use. 

This sounded really silly when I first came up with the idea, but it has been a lifesaver in terms or reducing food waste. It has felt even more important now that money has become more of an issue, and using the milk instead of dumping it down the drain feels much better inside.

As a final note, there are many foods which last a couple days past the expiration date, but cottage cheese is NOT one of them. It‚Äôs not worth it. It will smell fine, but it will probably still give you food poisoning.",30605,896

It's not always about money. Maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.

However, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. Management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. If half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.

Also, accepting a counter offer is NOT the end of the world as many would have you believe. It's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.



EDIT: Wow. Compensation is always a touchy subject. A few things to understand before you continue to assume that I am the world's worst manager.  

1. Someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  We get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  It's usually a small bucket.  I also never have the power to walk into HR and say ""Hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. Oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?""  In fact, I have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  

2. Seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled ""top performer"" is underpaid.  I can assure you that that isn't the case.  Many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  Go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...

3. Remember employment is a mutual agreement.  Everything is in play.  If you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  There is nothing wrong with that.  ",30450,2200
figaqs,amyt242,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/figaqs/,LifeProTips,LPT: Always carry a deck of playing cards,TRUE,"I have a very small life tip that is not epic but will certainly come in handy!

I was told when I was younger (and unfortunately cannot remember where) to always carry a pack of playing cards wherever I went - that I would never know when I might need them. They are cheap and they dont take up much space so whenever I change bags or backpacks I always ensure there is a pack of cards in there somewhere. I cannot tell you how often they have been useful!

If you end up stuck somewhere unexpected for an extended period of time, a pack of cards is a great way to keep everyone occupied and happy and make the time go quickly. The options for games are limitless! You will also be thought of favourably as the prudent one for having the cards with you in the first place!

This can also be great as an ice breaker if you are with people you dont really know but are stuck with through circumstance. Additionally if there are any worries or anxieties in the room eg. power cut or locked in somewhere for example, playing cards can take a lot of people's minds off of their unease and lift the tension.

Have a bored child on a train or waiting room with no toys? A pack of cards to a child can literally be hours of entertainment, you can practice numbers, magic, play snap, build card houses...

My husband is in the military and also swears by this tip - they take cards with them everywhere as you never know when you may have to wait around for hours and need something to do to keep boredom at bay.

One final tip I would say that make sure you know a few basic card games you could simply explain to others if needed to get things going but one of the good things about this would be if you do get stuck somewhere and have hours to kill with a colleague/friend/stranger, you also have the means to learn games from them and get talking etc! 

I know this is not going to go changing lives but hopefully may be helpful to someone :-)

That is a 100% personal choice.

What I mean by budget is just to say kids are expensive. Include daycare, essential items, insurance, and basically anything else you might be able to think of. Have money in your savings for unexpected expenses. And not just for the child either. Save for unexpected expenses for you and/or your spouce/partner 

Also budget more than just money. You're going to have to budget time and space. Practical practices can put you in a more practical perspective. Your patience is more likely than not to stretch thinner than your wallet. If you want kids these are things that will have to be sacrificed but as is the nature of sacrifices, things sacrificed will become things gained.

Babies also grow up into kids, and kids to teens. You'll spend money on different things but you'll still be spending it on them. Spending on things you think will be cute or fun that a baby/toddler wont remember and really detail finances when you need that money later in the child's life. Your baby is only a baby for so long such as a puppy will eventually grow into a dog.

Be prepared to blow your budget. You are a human after all and cant think of everything. However, if this is something you really want to do just know that if you wait until you have enough money to have a child, you'll never have a child. Don't wait forever, you'll get through it.

And one last thing, depending on the country, there's almost always assistance avaible. However, use things as a crutch when you need them, not a prosthetic leg. Food banks are wonderful and many places let babies/ kids in for free under a certain age. My parents actually survived financial drowning because a buffet near by let kids 2 and under eat free, of which my parents had 3 of.

Think but dont over think, much love to those with kids and those trying. Love to everyone else too but y'know I'm not talking to you lol.

Edit 2: ""if you wait until you have enough money, you'll never do it"" doesnt mean dont need enough to support everybody who you need to. It means that you dont need to have enough money for the child's entire life. People are saying that if they had all the money in an account rather than spending it on children that they'd then have enough money to buy a house.

The most obvious example is switching from written communication to paying a visit (or calling on the phone), or the other way around: leaving a conversation that doesn't lead anywhere and instead write a text message or an e-mail where you explain your position.

1. The pause gives you (and the counterpart) a chance to calm down, in case either of you is worked up.
2. It might give you a new approach to whatever the difference of opinion is about, since the new form of communication demands that you rethink it.
3. When writing emails/texting, many people accidentally come across as either blunt or sarcastic (especially if there's a difference of opinion going on). If that's how you interpret the other person, speaking to them might dispel your concerns.

wqtlyh,BackFromItaly,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/wqtlyh/,LifeProTips,LPT: Clean your marijuana tools regularly. Otherwise you could get sick.,TRUE,"Build up of residue inside your pieces will cause mold and other fungus'. The ash and wax has a lot of Nitrogen and Carbon that gets released into the water (for water pieces, and non-water pieces due to typical humidity levels) which promotes life/growth. You should rinse them out every couple uses, and if you see residue building up along the inside walls/once a week (even for light smokers) follow the cleaning procedure below:

&amp;#x200B;

* Rinse thoroughly with hot water.
   * I let mine sit in the sink with running hot water into the top so it flows out the bottom in a stream for a few minutes.
* Put some rubbing alcohol in there. (I try to use 90%, but 70% works too.)
* Cover both holes and gently shake for a minute. (This step is optional, unless it's really gross in your piece)
   * You can usually create a decent seal and still have a good grip using your palms.
   * Rinse again.
* Pour in coarse/table salt and more rubbing alcohol.
* Cover holes, gently shake the piece.
   * The salt 'scrapes' the gunk off the inner walls.
* Let it sit for a little bit soaking in the alcohol.
   * The more gunk, the longer it sits.
* Rinse with hot water.
* Add some Dawn (or other grease cleaning dish soaps) and a little hot water, then shake.
   * This is to get any residual alcohol out, and break up the last little bit.
* Rinse soap out!

&amp;#x200B;

If you need to clean a small pipe, and covering the holes isn't feasible, put it in a Ziploc bag and shake that up.

Repeat this process until clean. For me, the whole process above takes about 10 minutes and works much better than those expensive 'cleaning kits' you get at a headshop.

Don't forget pipe cleaners! They're cheap and well, designed for cleaning pipes.

Be safe, stay clean, marijuana is safe, but not if you've got colonies of bacteria or mold in your pipes.

Important note to this. Only Registered Dietitians or RDNs (registered Dietician Nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose &amp; treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, &amp; conditions such as eating disorders &amp; deficiencies.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
The next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ‚âà 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) Not understand the other person's argument

2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

Something like, ""Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?""

Now this has several benefits.  

--First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.

--Secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--Thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--Fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

You can also do the reverse.  Pause the argument and ask ""Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?

This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    And again, it helps to actually help define the EXACT problem...",29577,588

Turns out there were lilies in the bouqet and my cat ate some of the leaves. We had to rush my cat to the emergency vet, where he will be hooked up to an IV for 3 days. It's unknown if he will survive and the vet told me that it's very serious. On the offchance that he does survive, there will likely be permanent kidney damage. My cat has been by my side since I was a kid and I can't imagine losing my little buddy.

Since today is Valentine's Day, and Easter is coming up soon... Please be aware that **LILIES ARE POISONOUS TO CATS**. Even just breathing in the pollen can result in death.

""The entire lily plant is toxic: the stem, leaves, flowers, pollen, and even the water in a vase. Eating just a small amount of a leaf or flower petal, licking a few pollen grains off its fur while grooming, or drinking the water from the vase can cause your cat to develop fatal kidney failure in less than 3 days. The toxin, which only affects cats, has not been identified. Dogs that eat lilies may have minor stomach upset but they don‚Äôt develop kidney failure.""

**Here are the most toxic variety of lilies:**
- Asiatic lily (including hybrids)
- Daylily
- Easter lily
- Japanese Show lily
- Oriental lily
- Rubrum lily
- Stargazer lily
- Wood lily

Thank you for all of the kind wishes! I don't usually bring plants into the house, but these were a surprise gift and I was distracted by the holiday. Be safe everyone :(

**Update:** Max's chance of survival is looking pretty good, but he may need a few more days of treatment. He's been given charcoal and fluids, his kidney values are not normal but they're not alarming at the moment. I am overwhelmed by the amount of supportive comments and I'm so glad my post was able to help some kitties.

**Update #2:** Thank you so much to those who have donated, I'm crying happy tears of relief. We reached our fundraising goal and now we can afford to give Max the additional treatment he needs.

Be aware of the right way to do things and put effort into getting better in that manner, even if it is harder at first. In the long run, unlearning something wrong takes much, much longer than learning something correctly once.

Also, sucking is absolutely allowed; no one is good at something when they first try or will be able to do everything correctly in practice. The point of ""practice makes permanent"" is to warn against careless practice that may just end up being detrimental in the future if you let too many things slide. It's about identifying, preventing, or ""painting over"" bad habits to ensure you're spending your time effectively. When practicing, be conscious of what and how you are doing and take measures to ensure you are on the right track.

Every morning I write a short note to my wife and leave it on her nightstand for when she wakes up. These notes can be love notes, sexy NSFW notes, affirming notes, whatever I feel in the moment. Sometimes it‚Äôs an apology if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs owed.

Then my daughter gets a note which is inserted in her chrome book. I just open the laptop and stick the paper between the keyboard and screen. This is typically a note of encouragement with a reminder that I love her and I‚Äôm thankful for her. Sometimes I‚Äôll do a countdown to something I know she‚Äôs looking forward. The goal is to insert positivity into a day full of preteen angst.

Lastly, my middle child who is much younger gets a note in his prepared snack for preschool. Typically this is a fun seasonal drawing or a little message that his teacher can read to him. 

This daily ritual has had such a bigger impact on all of us than I‚Äôd ever realized it would.

For me, it serves as a time of mindfulness. It requires me to take a moment out of a busy morning and spend a short but focused amount of time on the people I care most for.

For my wife, it gets her day started in a positive way. It maintains passion and fun in our relationship. 

For my daughter, it reminds her that despite her being the oldest, especially with her siblings being much younger, she‚Äôs always on my mind. Additionally it‚Äôs a reminder for her that she‚Äôs a really cool kid and investing in her confidence is priceless.

Lastly for my son, it‚Äôs teaching him thoughtfulness and consistency. He knows no matter what happens, he‚Äôll get his little message. His teacher tells me he‚Äôs always more excited for the note than the snack, how fun is that?

My family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from Knology (now WOW) for over a decade.

That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.

On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.

Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers.

Summation of My Learning Experience

1. This is not the most ideal situation for any illegal trade. As so many original Redditors have established.

2. Alternatives include but are not limited to: Banks [my new fave], Fire Stations, Casinos [kinda cool] and ""crowded places."" (Not everyone is comfortable with the police.)

3. There's a lot of cool stories out there of people using this system.

4. There are many scary stories out there from people who haven't. 

5. There are a few crazy instances of violence in spite.

6. This applies to both buyers and sellers. Sorry I missed on the title.

I've seen this happen before tons of times‚Äîwell-meaning friends and relatives want to buy something for you, but since they don't quite understand, they end up getting you something that's essentially useless. And while you're incredibly grateful for the gesture, especially if a lot of money was spent, it's just uncomfortable, and it's a situation that could've been avoided had they taken the extra step to talk to you or a professional to see what kind of stuff would really be useful.

Of course, this often relates to money. Say your niece is a serious trumpet player and plays in a conservatory. You want to go all out, and decide to buy her a trumpet. You see that the highest-rated trumpets cost thousands of dollars, which of course you can't afford, so you end up buying her one for about $100. Definitely a kind gesture! And of course, no one's suggesting you should've bankrupted yourself to buy the professional model! But the trumpet you've bought her is essentially a toy that's actually useless to her at her level. Whereas if you'd spoken to her or a real trumpet player, you could've instead bought her a $50 professional mouthpiece, or a new edition of a book of √©tudes she's been wanting to play, which would have saved you money and served her for years.

I feel we feel expected to find love and relationships but, some of us just don't feel comfortable or gain happiness from that.

In the same way, those who enjoy their company might be confused why people prefer the company of others. Who's to say what is best. As long as we have no will to hurt others, we should feel comfortable whether we want to be around others or not. For some of us, finding ourselves and developing alone means much more than developing together.

du8l6b,nusensei,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/du8l6b/,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible",TRUE,"Speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. In fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. It's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. However, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.

The way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. The first game: play as normal and see who wins. You normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. There's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.

Second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. Suddenly, the room fell quiet. Each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. There was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.

This was then explained in the context of doing PowerPoint presentations. We have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. Turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. When the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.

Whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.

**Obligatory clarification edits:**

1. This is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. Don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this.
2. The key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. They must be aware that it is wrong.
3. Don't do this in a real, practical situation. This is a learning and training tip.",28187,463

For example: If you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

If you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. Anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

Instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. This will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
[EXTRA PROTIP: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. Even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.]

What this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. When unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

I never have to do much in my room. My closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. I have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. It works for them but I don't think thats an efficient method.

Of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

EDIT: Massive response, thanks! The point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

Also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. It's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
EDIT 2: When you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. This makes you less likely to clean as you go. Whats the point when you can do it later? So the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.

**Work out every day.** You go into this like a prison sentence thinking you‚Äôll have a six-pack by the time they lift the quarantine, but the stress of your remote work, caring for others etc doesn‚Äôt leave you the free time you thought it would. You are exhausted and stressed out. When you don‚Äôt get exercise, you stop being able to manage stress, you stop being able to sleep well, and there is nothing like insomnia to make you unravel. If you hate it, aim for 10 minutes. If you stop sleeping, know that exercise is the fastest way to reverse that.

**Socialize as much as possible.** Obviously from a safe distance or online, but it's so easy to fall into a pattern of work and TV, binging news, and self-isolation. Sharing your experience with others, talk, and human contact are critical. If you live with someone, (and therefore not practicing social distancing) make sure to hug them as much as possible. If you live alone, hug yourself, give yourself little massages, take long baths. We are tactile creatures and a lack of human contact can cause depression, stress, and poor health overall. Lack of touch can also exacerbate anxiety disorders and various mood disorders.

**Disconnect from the scary thing, and laugh as much as possible**: So easy to while away your days on twitter and news feeds trying to keep track of what‚Äôs going on. Terrible for mental health. Check in on that as needed, and then tear yourself away and feed your brain with books, and conversations with others, movies, and TV, online classes etc. Take advantage of all the stuff that is being made freely available, learn a skill whatever. Most of all, laugh. Watch comedies, read funny books, appreciate the ironies of the situations you‚Äôll inevitably encounter, write them down. Laughter releases endorphins, promoting well-being and relieving stress. Ideally, laugh with others.

**Help someone:** It makes you feel useful in a time when it's hard to feel useful. It's easy to question the point of your work when \*that\* is happening outside. Guaranteed there is someone nearby, literally and figuratively, who needs help. Put up a few signs offering to help those who need groceries or medicines, offer to walk dogs. Adopt a pet short term before the inevitable closure of shelters. Call family members, let stressed-out friends vent to you, be a safe space. If you have extra money, give it to someone who doesn‚Äôt. There are a million ways to help, and every one of them will make you and someone else feel better.

**Check in on your own mental health:** It‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôre fine, mental health issues often emerge like the boiling frog fable. Stop, take a minute and ask yourself how you‚Äôre doing. Ask for help when you need it, and know that lots of mental health support services are available online, including therapy over skype/zoom.

When I had initially started working for my company the rating was in the low 3's and the reviews were pretty sporadic in terms of the date.

Instead, apply for unemployment; worst case you'll be denied, but you may be approved.  Check your local laws to know if you qualify based on the conditions of  your termination. Also, if you're concerned/think that you may be  entitled to a wrongful termination suit, *keep your mouth shut* instead of firing back with indignation, no matter how angry you are.

Too upset to not keep your mouth shut? Remember there are other avenues to,  ""get back,"" at crappy employers. Report OSHA/workplace safety  violations, improper waste disposal, and other issues that can have legal ramifications for them, making sure to do so through the proper  channels. Hold the company responsible for their actions *without giving them leave to take legal action against you or prevent dispersal any wages/unemployment you may be due.* Not only is it satisfying, but you'll hopefully be making life better long-term for future employees of that company.

Edit: No one is saying to wait to be fired if you're in a toxic work environment; this is solely regarding scenarios where you're being fired and had not been planning to quit, had not put in your notice, etc. If you need to leave you job for your mental or physical health, do it. Advocate for yourself.

Don't lie if reporting a company to authorities about workplace safety violations and other such issues. Only file reports if they're true.

Not all places of employment write up termination paperwork prior to firing employees; ask for the conditions of your termination in writing (and know if you have a right to have this provided based on where you are).

To those in the comments whining about this being popular in TV/movies: yes, yes it is. It's meant to be a display of empowerment to the person quitting, *which can and has influenced people to make this poor decision.* I have personally known a couple of people who have done this and it bit them in the ass.

*Check your local laws* to know if you can file for unemployment benefits if you quit; there are some circumstances where you can, but this varies by area. Also know your local recording laws if you feel you'll need evidence on your side when you leave your post either from being terminated or quitting.

Unemployment benefits are not solely for those who have been laid off; terms of unemployment benefits vary by location, so do your homework.

It‚Äôs a lot easier to bar yourself from doing more work and then getting excited to add to your routine. 

What worked for me (and many friends/family that have followed) is to focus first on spending a full hour ***every day*** in the gym. For the first couple weeks, only let yourself use the treadmill‚Ä¶ start off walking, but make sure you spend the full hour in the gym ***every single day.***

It may feel silly to go to the gym and not sweat, but I promise that if you‚Äôre consistent this will work. 

After a couple days you‚Äôll probably notice that you want to do a little more than just walk for an hour‚Ä¶ maybe you start challenging yourself see how many miles you can fit into the hour. 

Eventually (once the hour EVERY DAY) becomes part of your normal routine, you‚Äôll find yourself actively wanting to try other exercises to fill up your gym time, ***and it will be enjoyable.***

Start will the lowest weights you can. It will feel silly to bench press 5-10lb dumbbells at first, but again‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll find yourself wanting the additional challenge later. 

Then you might start challenging yourself to eat better, as to not ruin all the work you‚Äôve been putting in at the gym. 

6-8 weeks in and your body will start to show progress, whether or not you‚Äôve started your journey to lifting (which is the end goal). 

You can do it. Get started. Stay consistent. Your physical, and more importantly, mental health will thank you for it.

Edit: Don‚Äôt care what you say. My advice revolves around THE GYM. Going physically to THE GYM. The space is important.

Edit 2: A lot of ‚Äúum ackchewally‚Äù comments followed with how they are ***attempting*** to get past their fitness struggles‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúthis may work for some‚Äù while you aren‚Äôt fit at all or are struggling to get there. ***If*** you can make it to the gym for an hour a day‚Äîthis method *will* work.

Final edit: For those of you who are gym rats‚Äîtry and remember how hard it was for you to start (unless you are an athlete, which kind of forces the habit to start). When I was a gym rat before Covid, I remember thinking to myself wtf all these people need to just start it‚Äôs so easy to be consistent and fit.

1. Have pads and tampons in your bathroom - Even if you live alone, buy some tampons and sanitary pads, and keep them in your bathroom. It may happen, that there is a party at your place or someone simply comes over and gets unexpected period (sometimes they come a few days earlier, it just happens) - just let the girls know that you have their back in that case. You can tell them discreetly or just have a box marked ""pads and tampons :)"" in a visible place in your bathroom. 

EDIT: Some people said that if the single guy starts dating someone and she sees pads and tampons in the bathroom, she may become suspicious and think he's cheating. 
I think that it's good to tell your date about that emergency box and the reason you have it. You can say that you saw a Reddit post and thought it was a good idea. If you have a sister you can mention her. Just talk with your date. 

2. Emergency pad or tampon in your car glove box is okay - doesn't take much place, can save someones day.
EDIT: Not obligatory of course, and if you do it put the product in ziplock bags so they stay clean and fresh. 

3. Every girl goes through period differently, so if you only experienced a girl that is acting normal, able to go jogging every morning and feeling all right on her period, don't say anything like ""you are overreacting"" or ""this can't be that bad"", or ""you are exxagerating"" when you see a girl who says she's very weak and feeling awful, suffering from bad cramps.

EDIT: changed ""simulating"" to ""exxagerating"" - I am not a native speaker and just copied the word from my language and hoped it will work lol


4. If you are close with the girl, ask her about her period preferences - some girls prefer to stay at home and nap a lot, some prefer staying active and going for walks. Some girls crave salty foods, some crave chocolates. Ask her if she uses any specific painkillers for her menstrual cramps and buy them to have at your place. 

EDIT: Yes, asking random girls out of nowhere about her period preferences is super creepy. This is why I said ""CLOSE with the girl"". If that's your girlfriend, I think there is nothing creepy in talking with her about her period. ""How can I help when you're on your period?"", ""What do you usually crave more - salty food or sweets?"" etc. 
Definitely don't ask random girls that question, but if it's a relationship and you take each other seriously, this can be helpful. 

5. If you want to have any pills to help with menstrual cramps, look for something that is both a painkiller and relax muscles. You can ask a pharmacist, they will help you.

6. If you notice that a girl has a blood stain on her pants, tell her discreetly. Offer your jacket if you can, so she can tie it around her waist and at least cover the stain. 

7. If a girlfriend on her period stays overnight, you can offer a towel (some old one) so she can put it under her butt - if there is any leaking, it won't stain your bed, and she won't feel uncomfortable for leaving a stain. But ask first I guess. 

8. If there is a blood stain already, you can use:
- Cold water (if it's fresh)
- Hydrogen peroxide
- Baking soda
- Vinegar

9. Girl may cry for ""no reason"" - she saw an TV ad where dog got some no-name brand food and was sad because he wanted his favourite Advertised Brand Food - boom, she's sobbing. Don't say anything like ""this is not a reason to cry, stop acting like a baby"". She is probably aware that this is a stupid reason, she just can't fight her period-mind acting like that. Better say that this dog is just an actor trained to act like that, and he for sure got a belly rub after it was recorded and got a favourite snack.

Check if their address is from china. Check how long they have been selling. Check if they have good reviews. Check if they have a customer service phone.

If they are from china, with zero reviews, and no phone. Chances are you'll be dealing with Johny and you'll have a bad time.


Amazon does have the a-to-z guarantee where they'll help you if the seller doesn't, but it takes more time, you will not get the product only a refund/partial refund, and it doesn't always apply as it's more restrictive than the normal guarantee.

All of this applies to sellers that ship the items themselves. If it's FBA you should have less issues.

Please save yourself, and Amazon customer service reps, from a bad time and be super wary of the third party sellers that fulfil the items themselves.",27149,1187

In the last few years, my ability to engage with strangers has dramatically started to improve due to an unexpected influence - marketing books.  The more books I read by guys like Seth Godin or Donald Miller, the more I started focusing on other people and trying to understand them and how I can be valuable to them and make their day a little better.  This hasn't brought me any huge financial success, but it HAS significantly improved my ability to chat with strangers.

My guess is because trying to drum up the ""courage"" to go talk to a stranger is by default putting them in a somewhat adversarial position.  The question ""What if they don't like me?"" I used to always agonize over is very inwardly focused, defensive and egotistical.

Instead, when I started focusing more on bringing value to that other person in some small way, the mission of increasing net happiness on the planet helped me break away from my need to be ""liked"" at least for a few moments at a time - long enough to break the ice in new conversations and discover 9 times out of 10 that the other person has zero negative opinion about you whatsoever.  Their opinion is pretty much based on the value you bring and the amount of empathy you can express.

That's all.  Just a word of encouragement.  Best of luck!

qhpx3o,zarmril,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/qhpx3o/,LifeProTips,"LPT: At railroad level crossings in the US, the ‚Äúlittle blue sign‚Äù will save your life. The sign gives drivers who are stuck on the tracks a 1-800 number to call. Instead of calling 911, this number will directly contact a railroad dispatcher to stop oncoming trains.",TRUE,"Next time you pass a railroad level crossing, look for the [‚Äúlittle blue sign.‚Äù](https://www.nprillinois.org/statehouse/2017-09-11/railroad-safety-look-for-the-blue-sign)

Edit: The sign is \~about 8"" x 5"".  It is located on the ""Crossbuck,"" which is the traffic sign in the shape of an 'X' that says ""Railroad Crossing."" In most cases, the crossbuck will also have red flashing lights and a boom gate that drops when a train is nearby. If your crossbuck has red flashing lights, the blue sign is located directly below the set of red flashing lights.

Edit: Yes, you should obviously get out of your car to call the railroad dispatcher. In fact, you won't likely be able to see the sign if you are inside your car. So hop out, then look for the sign. A locomotive crashing into a vehicle can have significant damaging effects, throwing lots of debris in the vicinity that can injure you or others. Furthermore, even small impacts at high speeds can be very damaging for train passengers and crew.  **Imagine a train crashing into a 25-ton dump truck. The engineer is dead, and likely anyone else near the cab of the locomotive.**

Edit: You might be asking, ""How do cars even get stuck on railroad tracks?"" Keep in mind that ""Stuck"" is the keyword here. It's rare for a car to simply break down on a track. At crossings with gates, if you can believe it, people ignore warning bells and lights, drive onto the tracks and the gates come down and trap them. Of course, they could easily drive through the gates but most people panic and that's where they can't get the car going. Furthermore, many level crossings have an increase in height compared to the regular road surface. Therefore, there is not enough clearance for longer vehicles such as semi-trailers and limos. They can then become grounded on the 'hump.‚Äô

She said, ""Getting two cats solves so many problems.""  And here they are:

Kittens are demanding and very social creatures whose curiosity is boundless and they have the capacity to destroy things when they are under-stimulated.  This might seem like the lowest hanging fruit for cat fans in the world, but trust me, we really were going to get a single kitten and it would have been a disaster for that cat.  Watching these two kittens play teaches me that we would never have been able to keep up with the stimulatory needs of a single cat.  We are both working and our kids go to school.  This cat would surely have been lonely and bored during the day -- but now -- with two they are both in constant motion and amusement. 

It is the most remarkable and joyful activity to watch them simply playing with each other.  They are both great cuddlers when they visit with out laps, but when we are not devoted to them, they are devoted to one another.

I know this might sound simple or not worth listening to, but the difference in their temperament to the kitten we had for eighteen years is night and day.  We loved that cat but it was no where near as playful or happy as these two.

Yes -- there is a little bit more responsibility with two -- more feeding and cleaning of course.  But there is twice as much joy for us and ten times as much joy for them.  If someone else has already written about this, view my post as simply a celebration of this as a fact.

Over the last 3 years, I've worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area, therefore saving me a lot of time and money. I thought I would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area. Please feel free to share any additional tricks you have!


**Get started.**

Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.


**Meal planning**

1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an ""easy"" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.

2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money. 

3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 ""fend for yourself night"" and 1 night of eating out. 

4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.  

5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a ""grab n go"" breakfast. 


**Make your grocery list**

1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.

2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.

3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)

4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week. 

5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request. 

6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce. 


**Get to the store**

1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!

2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.

3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.

4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!

5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* ""buy one get one half off"" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.


There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.


**Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**

1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.

2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.

3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning. 

4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration. 

5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.

6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration,  but I change them depending on my preferences. 

6. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.

7. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.

I live in Hurricane country and it continues to boggle my mind that people buy a few extra cans of creamed corn and call it their emergency rations. You may be without power for a while and it may be a while longer before you can get real food again. A can of creamed corn a day isn‚Äôt going to keep you full or satisfied. 

My current stockpile as a single person (I rotate through and replace), which I hope to last at least a week if needed:

1. At least 2 16 packs of toaster pastries. I eat these daily for breakfast anyway. 

2. Bread and peanut butter. I always have an unopened backup. 

3. Canned beans (and I‚Äôm not talking green beans but more like black/kidney/garbanzo and similar) are my main canned staple. They provide protein and slow digesting carbs and will keep you fuller longer. I keep about 10 cans on hand. 

4. Canned tomatoes pair well with the beans and often come seasoned. 10 cans. 

5. A couple cans of peas, green beans, mushrooms and pineapple for variety. Probably only 10 cans total. 

6. Canned meats (chicken and tuna, though salmon/sardines/spam would fall in this category). Again about 10 cans. Protein will keep you full. 

7. Single serving fruit cups. Remember you may not have anywhere to keep your opened cans from going bad. 2 4-packs. 

6. Granola bars, dry cereal, dried fruits and chips/pretzels/cookies. I don‚Äôt keep a set number but they are on hand. 

7. When the power comes on and you can cook again, you may very well be sick of canned food, but the grocery store hasn‚Äôt restocked and restaurants that are open may be crowded. So, some boxed pasta/rice/other pantry food that requires cooking but not refrigeration is nice to have on hand. 

8. Seasoning. Hot sauce. Packets of salad dressing that don‚Äôt need refrigeration. Salt and pepper. You don‚Äôt want to eat bland food. Prepare now so you won‚Äôt suffer then. 

The longest my power has ever personally been out was 4 days for Hurricane Irma, but you never know. And don‚Äôt wait for a storm to approach either. Start buying a few cans now. Worst case scenario you donate them at Thanksgiving, or cycle through them like me.",25407,1285

57‚Äù (145cm) puts pictures right at an optimal position, and is the accepted ‚Äústandard gallery‚Äù viewing height.  When you use this as a standard, your living space will look much cozier.  There is always an exception of course but this is a good rule of thumb.

Do a little math to figure out where to poke your hole on the wall:

1.	Measure your picture‚Äôs height and halve it. 

2.	Figure out how far the distance from the top edge of the picture is to what the picture will actually hang on.  Sometimes that‚Äôs a piece of wire - take your finger and pull the wire up like it‚Äôs hanging on a wall, and measure from your finger to the top of the frame.  Or, if it‚Äôs a hanging clip, measure the distance from the top of the clip to the top of the frame.  Subtract this from the first value.

3.	Add 57 if working in inches, (or 145 if working in centimeters)

Example:  
I have a picture that‚Äôs 24‚Äù tall.  Half of that is 12‚Äù.  The hanging wire when fully taught leaves 3.25‚Äù from the top of the picture.

So, 12 - 3.25 + 57 = 65.75‚Äù

Measure up from the floor 65.75‚Äù and make your hole!

Now before I continue, I happen to find this extremely fascinating, others may find this extremely creepy. However, do what you will with this information.

First, in order to start this, make sure you're **signed into Google using a Gmail account you've been using the longest**. The older the account, the more farther back you can look. Next go to [myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com) and you're almost there. Here where it may get creepy. It shows all your Google searches and how many times and at what times you visited any websites, searched anything on Google, and which apps you've opened. Yeah, pretty creepy. But whatever, I think you can delete it somewhere.

Next, you can click on the filter options, and just think back to when you created your Gmail account. I created mine sometime before 2012, so my account is perfect for this. Long story short, filter the options using only the dates and set it to January 1st, 20XX, whatever that might be for you. And there you go, look back to what you Googled and which apps you were using and whatnot. More often than not, this will be nostalgic, and a bit creepy. But whatever. After looking back for a bit, I started rememebering what video games I was playing, which YouTubers I used to watch, and what information I was Googling.

Stay safe and Happy New Years.

EDIT: It's organized in a very weird way. You cannot choose to view older information first. Newest is always at the top. Click ""Before"" instead of ""After"" and select the date to be January 20XX, being one year ahead of the year you wanna view. Also you must view newest to oldest and cannot change it.

Some ideas that some have commented below include dishwashers, laundry machines, phones, speakers. Use this as a first method for troubleshooting, but remember its not a fail safe. 

Also please power down whatever it is your attempting to fix first!

Process:

Power Off - &gt; Remove Power Cord -&gt; Remove Battery(if available) -&gt; Hold Power button -&gt; Test.

Why it works?

When you do this you're basically discharging any stored power inside the units capacitors, this allows the units computer to ""forget"" the last failed attempt to turn on or run properly, allowing it to reset and run in its intended state. 

What if there's no power button?

Did ya check under? The sides? Behind? Every TV has a button(as im aware), but in the rare occasion it does not...

Power it down and leave it unplugged overnight, it'll provide the same effect.

There are are 2 groups of very hesitant people in the comments. The 'my city is too dangerous' group and the 'my area is too boring' group.  Please don't put yourselves in danger.  The areas you pick should obviously be relatively safe.  And I realize density of 'interesting' spots will vary.  The spots you pick don't need to stand out as interesting though.   Just spots you haven't really explored, other than mindlessly passing through.  
Here's what I'm getting at.  You may have walked down a street a bunch of times on your way to x, y, or z.   When you did that you were on a mission, and likely didn't take in your surroundings.   Go without a specific end point in mind, and with a sense of curiosity.   Curiosity is the key.

Here's how I picked spots.  Used Google maps on map view.  I looked for green areas, and zoomed in a bit to make sure they weren't private, then maybe switched to see if there were trees, or just fields, any water features, etc before deciding to add them.  Then I looked for yellow stretches along roads that denote commercial areas.  and added those.   Commercial areas are great, especially in quieter, or run down neighborhoods because you get mom 'n pop type places and never know what interesting things or people you might run into.   

*alright, another edit*
Lots of people are suggesting geocaching, or Pokemon Go.  Both are fun, and a great way to get off the  couch.  So is running, and strenuous hiking.  I think this is different because there is no specific thing to look for, or destination to reach.  We stroll to get a little air, and to give ourselves a chance to observe, interact with, and appreciate the details in our surroundings.

If these people care enough to check up on the animal, they most likely would not have given the animals away if the true intent were known. Sketchy. 

Edit: Wow, this ended up being a really controversial topic. For the record, this is a true story. This woman is emotionally unstable, and quite frankly, doesn't have the mental agility to pull off a prank on this level as some have suggested. I do agree with many of you who have pointed out the possible warning signs of a sociopath, and I will definitely be reporting her. Thank you to all those who PM'd me resources and contact information. 

Also, I had never considered the concept of the bait dogs/fighting dogs and I found that to be enlightening as well.  As some have mentioned, the dog fighting rings may be the bigger more prominent threat. There were many comments that mentioned the fee really doesn't solve the problem, and that solid interviewing and vetting of new owners is a better strategy. I do not disagree. The argument of spaying/neutering pets was also made, and again, I do not disagree. The purpose of this post was not to spark ethical debate about the food chain, or which type of animals should be labeled ""food"" vs. ""pets"". Nor was the purpose of this post to vilify snakes or their responsible owners. This story would have read the same, even if the animal she owned was a Saltwater Crocodile. 

My goal in sharing this post was to raise awareness that there are sketchy people out there who are dishonest in their dealings, and who may not have your pet's best interest at heart. So, whether charging a fee, or conducting more extensive interviews, or spaying/neutering, we can all be a little more responsible with the animals we value, to make sure that they do not needlessly suffer. Hence the LPT.

z921bo,ButtholeBanquets,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/z921bo/,LifeProTips,"LPT: With winter coming, if you're new to cold weather or cold climates, you should learn how to layer your clothes. Layering properly is much more effective than buying a large, bulky coat or relying on a single ""warm"" item to keep you comfortable.",TRUE,"Layering clothing is essential for cold climates. With proper layering you can comfortably operate in a range of temperatures as you can add or remove layers if you get hot or cold throughout the day.

Basically, you should approach layering as a function of threes.

1. **Base layer.** A base layer is the one that is against your skin. A good base layer provides moisture (sweat) wicking materials while being thin enough to allow you to add layers above it. Merino wool socks, long underwear, and a long sleeve moisture wicking shirt are good for base layering.
2. **Middle Layer.** A middle layer is the insulation. It allows your body to keep warm air against your skin so you function as your own heater without letting too much warm air escape. A fleece zipped top can be effective here, for example.
3. **Outer layer.** Outer layers are designed to stop the wind from taking away that blanket of warm air your body made and your middle layer is keeping close, as well as provide moisture protection (rain and snow). They should be easily removable so you can de-layer as you heat up. Wind or rain resistant outer shells along with hats, gloves, and moisture resistant footwear can be used here.

**Layering/Delayering.** As the day goes on you may have to remove layers or add them back on. If, for example, you start your day in the dark and it's windy, but later you're out in the sun and the wind dies down, you may find yourself getting warmer. Taking a layer or two off to keep yourself from sweating is important. (If you're sweating in the cold this can quickly lead to frostbite.) If the wind picks back up, you stop being active, or it becomes cloudy, adding layers back will help you warm up again.

You can also layer for hot weather, rainy weather, or variable weather using different materials and articles of clothing. Planning ahead and having the right elements before you go into the environment will go a long way in keeping you warm, comfortable, and safe.",24816,1054

I know times are hard with COVID and some of you may feel you are stuck. This advice is to help you cope until you can find another job and you SHOULD be looking and you SHOULD be planning a exit strategy.

If you are in a hostile or toxic work environment I assume HR already knows this and is complicit. So IGNORE HR I see people saying go to HR this is a bad idea HR is there to protect the company. They will attempt to gaslight you and make you seem like the one with the problem ie: ""why aren't you getting along with our awesome team?!"". Say a abusive manager has been there 10+ yrs. If they have been their that long HR/uppers know they don't care! They won't change, start looking elsewhere!

From now on no verbal conversations unless they are work related. EMAIL ONLY and PRINT COPIES!!! If they talk to you or ambush you stay calm be professional and write a email later detailing the conversation bullet point by bullet point.

Keep a work journal documenting your feelings and interactions with them. The good and the bad, even days when nothing of note happened. This will help you see their and your own patterns and give you a more constructive way to deal with it as opposed to thinking about it all day.

Build a support network. Start a Hobby! Go out with friends and family. Try to hang out with people who enjoy your company. Build relationships outside your team/workplace (but do not get distracted or in trouble). This will set you up for a lateral move if possible or they could help you find a new job or with a school program. In other words don't contract your world and shrivel away expand it to the point were the rumors and lies can't touch you.

To be clear, not all people are terrible, I am saying this if you decide to keep staying at your job. Being exposed to that 8 hrs a day 7 days a week will warp your reality and jade even the most optimistic person. There are some great people out their who do not behave this way one just has to find them.¬†

Don't let them intimidate you from doing your job. You know what you are doing you got it!¬†

Best of luck!¬†

Where are you?"" after hearing a name the scammer will assume that identity ""Yes, this is Jake, my car broke down in another province and I need you to transfer me money to get it repaired so I can come home.""  

The problem here is the victim asked who was on the other end of the phone.  When calling your grandparents, when they pick up the phone you say ""Hi Grandma, it's Jake.""  
That way they know that if one day someone calls asking for money, they not only know not to ask who it is by giving a name.  But they also know that if the person does say it's you that that couldn't be true because you always give your name when you call.


I started doing this with my grandmother after she told me she got a call one time just like the one I described above.  Someone called and said they were in jail and needed money for bail.  She said ""Oh, is this Jake?"" and the scammer said ""Yes it is.""  They insisted she didn't need  to come  to the police station but that they definitely needed the money.  She went to the bank to make the withdrawal and the excellent tellers realized it was a scam and stopped her.  
Since then I told her I would always give my name when I call and have been doing so for years.  
She had one other time someone called and she asked who was on the phone (asking for mine or my brothers name) and the scammer said it was me.  She realized that couldn't be right because I always say it's me after saying hello.",23923,742

Before you come at me in the comments talking about how your brother's sister's uncle's best friend's cousins called an ambulance and was seen faster because xyz, read the post in it's entirety.

Anyway.

The speed at which you are seen at the emergency room is determined based on the urgency of your problem.

Your problem may seem urgent to you, of course, but your broken arm will always come second to someone having an active heart attack. 

You can save yourself some money, and time, by driving to the ER **as long as you feel safe driving or have a driver.**

As an EMT in a busy 911 system, I promise you, I absolutely can and will wheel you out to the same waiting room you'd have walked into if you had driven to the hospital yourself.

EDIT:

Wow, this blew up. 

So just wanted to address one thing, this post is *not* intended to shame you out of taking an ambulance if you really need it. This post is more aimed towards those who think that their mildly annoying seasonal allergies are a sufficient reason to dial 911. 

If you are having symptoms of a stroke, heart attack, bleeding profusely, have burns to multiple places on your body, have any sort of penetrating trauma or multi-system trauma, ***call us.***

If you feel like you can't stand up on your own, if you don't have family/friends, or if your family/friends are unable to assist you to the ER, ***CALL US.***

By all means, we are here to serve you and respond to your emergencies. But if your situation isnt emergent, and you could fix your problem in several hours and be fine, then think twice about calling **emergency** transport.

EDIT 2:

""ThIs OnLy aPpLiEs tO tHe USA!!1!1!""

Only the ""save you money"" portion. That one was thrown in especially for my country, because we have a dystopian healthcare system. Yes, I am aware of this.

Taking an ambulance when it isn't a life threatening emergency in several other countries would likely result in the same wait time, because all hospitals have a triage system. 

If you don't need to be fixed *right this instant,* you will probably wait. That's just the nature of hospital care. 

You are being assessed and sorted by your presentation, condition, symptoms and severity of your illness/injury as soon as you walk through the door. As *soon as hospital staff lays eyes on you,* they can generally tell whether or not you'll be fit for the waiting room, or if you need to be seen immediately. This isn't exclusive to the US, and I know several emergency medical providers in other countries who can all confirm this.

""So you're expecting average people to assess themselves properly? You're putting lives in danger with this advice!""

If you *think* that your situation is emergent, call. 

Period.

That's literally my job. Give us a call and we'll show up.

All I'm asking is to think *a little bit* about what an emergency is, before you call an ambulance and tie them up. Because they can't respond to anywhere else until you're off the bus.

Did you stub your toe? Not an emergency. Even if it hurts real bad. 

Are you suddenly unable to move the right side of your body? **Emergency.**

Do you just feel kinda stuffy and weak today? You're probably sick. Take some over the counter meds and call your doctor to schedule an appointment. Not an emergency.

Do you suddenly feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest, and have radiating pain to your neck/jaw/shoulder? **Emergency.**

Imagine your family member is having a medical crisis that undoubtedly falls into the **super fucking emergent** category. 

Now imagine no ambulance is available at the time to respond, because someone wants their prescriptions refilled and doesn't feel like waiting in line at a pharmacy. So they called the only available ambulance to take them to the whole ass emergency room, just to refill meds. And we can't deny transport. So we're tied up with this person until they're signed for.

sob8q3,ObsidianLion,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/sob8q3/,LifeProTips,LPT Breaking performance records at your job is in most cases detrimental,TRUE,"LPT: Be careful at breaking performance records in your company. If you can do it, it will become the new standard and in most cases, you will be expected to meet that record regularly, with minimal or no additional pay.

Literally every company I ever worked at did this. Someone would break a key performance indicator out of boredom, or to prove themselves, higher ups would notice it is possible, and that would be the new norm for everyone.

\----------------------------------

I work in a sales position. Back in late 2020, selling 4 units (per transaction) of a product was top agent (company is new and inexperienced with the market). Then one employee got angry one day because she thought she deserved a raise, and sold 6 units the whole day, thereby raising her average price (she got promoted much later, which she hated because of the higher stress, and transferred back, but the damage was done). Everyone was expected to follow her results to not lose their job.

Then one day, another employee did double the number of finished sales compared to the average, simply because he was bored. What he did was extremely stupid. He has shown that one person can do the output of 2. Do *you* like the workload of 2 people? Yup, a week later, everyone was expected to do 50% more orders (45) for the same pay.

Another time, a new guy was promoted and he wanted everyone to increase their average price or they get transferred to a different department. This was to justify his promotion. Most people did improve their average price. Increased the department revenue by 17% on average. Right next month, we had to meet that new standard to get the same bonus we were getting before with less stress.

Now, a year and a half later, we are expected to sell 10 units per transaction (and it's possible). The salary has improved, but not even close to company profits and daily stress. This is common in every job, so saying ""that job sucks"" is ignorant.

**Just because you can do better, that doesn't mean that doing so will result in a long-term benefit for you or your colleagues**. In our company, the requirements for the same bonus were raised 3 times because of this. Work smarter, not harder.

Bonus tip: Also be careful of playful bets and games. Anything that starts with ""I bet you can't sell/do more than X, in this amount of time!"" is a lead in to the same issue. A month ago, the boss of our boss made a bet that the department can't sell 50 of a certain product by the end of second shift. If we win the bet, we get free drinks on the boss! We won, got our drinks, and 3 days later everyone was expected to sell one such product with every transaction or get demerits (deductions from our daily bonus).

EDIT: I have finally gone through all comments. Took me a few hours. I noticed a misunderstanding among some people, which I will clear up here.

1. **NOWHERE** did I write that people should do as little as possible, the bare minimum. I hate that attitude in people. I myself was always among the top performers in the companies I work for, because I want to do my work properly, and refused 2 promotions because they didn't align with my goals (I want more free time, not more money), but after learning the lesson above in my previous job, I advise to THINK carefully if crossing a record will be beneficial LONG-TERM, not just once and then get screwed with the new raised expectations. Most companies DO NOT give linear growth between output and pay, and MANY do not give a permanent pay increase for increased expectations, but give you a one off prize, and then you are expected to achieve those amazing results continuously.
2. Some people made no difference between a job and a career.  This makes a huge difference.
3. Many people think every job allows you to negotiate a raise. Your raise is the ability to work even harder to get more money (but they have raised the bar 3 times when people were earning a little too much for their liking). Everyone is replaceable. This is the official stance of my company.
4. Top performers in my company also are the biggest liars to customers. Management knows and doesn't interfere anymore with the lying, because they did so once and saw a dip in sales. Money&gt;morals. Oh but they do give regularly to charities, single moms, people who are in need of money because of an illness, orphanages, etc. so that makes it all good, right? Screw us who just wanna do decent and not burn out, people who don't see their job as the reason for their existence.
5. I know the company I work for is bad (and am making exit plans), but I am disillusioned and do not believe that there is any company that will not become like this as time moves on.  


 UPDATE: 17.02.

It is with great joy that I can announce, that I have resigned from the company I spoke of in this post. I have been given an offer in a better company and have 1-2 months until I start working in a new company.

I was already out the door with one foot until they did another record breaking blunder. The supervisor made 2 teams, dividing the employees. A sale above a certain amount (which was 20% higher than the average amount we used) would be a point. The group that loses stays overtime one hour for that shift. Both teams combined broke a company record. In the same sentence the supervisor clapped for breaking the record, and said the losing team will work on the weekend overtime by one hour, instead of in that shift. That was the last straw. Also, 3 other people resigned as well, among them one of the 4 top agents. One female colleague resigned without having a new job, but she was bedridden for 2 weeks from the stress.

Especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.

I've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while I build everything with passion and perfection that I take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* I often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when I'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. Before it was a profession I had great enjoyment for the process, but now I just can't help but count the minutes that I'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. The business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.

If you're going to turn your hobby into a business:

* Start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. Start slow and small.
* Manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week. 
* Never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. Be strict about this.
* Avoid ""Commission Hell"" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on.
* Charge appropriately. Don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. Don't charge more than your quality is worth. See what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically.
* Cramming will destroy your soul. If you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you WILL burn out very quickly. If you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish.
* Motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. You need *discipline.* If you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.

Enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. Keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.

Edit: Let me restate what I said at the top, since some people are dismissing the whole post. *This is a common occurrence with artists and hobbyists who take their passion and turn it to work*, it's **NOT THE RULE**. If you are doing what you love, wonderful. This doesn't always work for everyone though, and it's better to be prepared for something other than what you imagine going in or you might get in over your head and hate something you once loved. I'm not discouraging anyone from pursuing their passions, just the opposite, preserve your passions and pursue them with the right goals and mindset.

5hsx5d,unusedmonitor2,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5hsx5d/,LifeProTips,"LPT: View your time as an investment, and pay attention to what gives you the greatest return",TRUE,"Think of how stingy you are with your money: if someone on the street asks for $10, you're not giving it to them. There's no way you're giving a 30% tip for a normal dining experience. And so on. 

And yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time. We throw it away, every day. I know I do unless I'm careful. What helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment, and to keep track of the returns I get for my investment. 

This approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment: a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments, for example, gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song. That's an incredible return. Other investments are more like low-interest, high security, long-term investments: going to the gym, eating right, etc. Some, like reading good books, are kind of a combination of both. 

But many activities are worthless from an investment perspective: whatever benefit they seem to give doesn't last any longer than the activity itself. Reddit is a great example: I can get super-invested in a Reddit conversation, but at the end, the second I shut down my computer, I've gained nothing in return. It gives me absolutely nothing of value. I've invested my time into junk. 

Edit: Some obvious things here. First of all, what's valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement. If you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want, then by all means, fill your boots. It doesn't build the life that I want, though - and yes, I'm aware that that seems hypocritical, but the fact is that I am highly aware that I'm procrastinating right now, and that I'll loathe my time spent on reddit when I lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight. 

EDIT: SORRY I CRITICIZED REDDIT OMG. But for real, maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than I am. You come for salient information, trenchant and high-minded interactions with others, and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner. Not I. Reddit is one of my boogeymen, so feel free to substitute your own time-waster.

Final edit: holy smokes, if I would have known this was going to blow up, I would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer. There's some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point I was trying to make. First of all, the examples that I used were all solitary pursuits, but that was just random - for instance, for myself, I don't think that there's a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends, or going on trips with friends and family. Those memories last a lifetime. Absolutely worth every second - and dollar. Secondly, I definitely don't want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste - that's the exact opposite of what I'm trying to say. Experiences, rather than material things, are what I've chased for most of my adult life. 

Really, this never should have blown up because it's not profound in the least. We all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness. All I was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment, and to question what return on it I'm getting. Investing my time in learning a new skill, being a good husband and father, making new memories with friends and family - those investments will yield a good life. Other investments won't - eating junk food late at night on Reddit, for example. And for me, yes, Reddit is a serious time sink - something that I'm trying to deal with. 

Lastly, I'd push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isn't wasted. Mostly, I agree, but sometimes, avoidance takes the form of enjoyment: if there's something that I know I need to do, and I watch Netflix instead, hell yeah I enjoy myself during that time. Doesn't mean that it wasn't a shitty investment of time, though. So, don't confuse avoidance/escapism with true enjoyment.",23282,1068

We do this to avoid pain, but the reality is that it only prolongs it. Instead, if you find yourself arguing a point with someone, step back and honestly ask yourself if you‚Äôre wrong. This is a skill, so it can take some time to start doing reliably. If you find you‚Äôre wrong, admit it. The faster you switch from wrong to right, the faster the pain goes away. And your brain will ‚Äúforget‚Äù you were ever wrong. 

Besides getting through the pain of being wrong faster, this will make you wiser (challenging and removing bad beliefs) and will often lead to people respecting you more.

I remember when I was quitting my last job that I felt heavy guilt. A day or two later I forgot about everyone there. 

Some jobs will try and make you feel guilty for leaving but once you leave, you‚Äôll become old news. Your fellow staff members may be sad that you‚Äôre leaving, but they‚Äôll forget after an hour. 

Recalling my first job when one of my coworkers were leaving, it was a whole going away party while she was there. The moment she left, it was back to regular programming.

So if you‚Äôre feeling like leaving for whatever reason then leave cause in the end of the day, you‚Äôre replaceable and even if you aren‚Äôt replaceable‚Ä¶YOU‚ÄôRE REPLACEABLE!

This is a tip for myself too.

Edit 1: I really don‚Äôt understand how people can misunderstand my post, I‚Äôm not saying that you should leave your job out of nowhere, burn bridges or what have you 

I‚Äôm saying that if you **WANT** to leave your job and you‚Äôre feeling guilty **DON‚ÄôT** cause after you leave people will move on. Regardless if you‚Äôre on good terms with everyone or not, people will find a replacement. They may not be as good as you‚Ä¶but you‚Äôll be replaced, they may miss you‚Ä¶but they‚Äôll still have to find a replacement. 

If you‚Äôre in a great position, then by all means stay if you want to. If you have a manager that is great to you, **AMAZING**. But for people who are being manipulated into staying in their jobs or whatever and you wanna leave, do yourself the favour and leave. The cogs will keep rolling with or without you.

rou4hu,SonDontPlay,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/rou4hu/,LifeProTips,"LPT: Do not let your job get in the way of important things in your life, the worst thing they can do is fire you...which may not be that bad.",TRUE,"This post is inspired by the death of a friend, and how his good friend wasn't given time off to go to the funeral. No one ever lays on their death bed and says ""Man, I should have worked harder at my job"" 

If you have an important thing in your life that you want to attend, and your job says you can't go because you have to work, feel free to make it clear, you aren't asking for permission, you are telling them what you are going to do. If they refuse and say you have to work...then...don't show up to work. Also, be very clear. As in:

""I understand you plan on having me work this day, I will not show up that day.""

I myself have had this happen twice in my life, on both occasions I did not show up to work and went and did what was important to me. The first instance was my high school graduation, I told my manager I was taking that night off, my manager said no, I said you can schedule me, but I won't be there. He scheduled me, I didn't show up. On the next day, I was scheduled to work, he wrote me up and I quit, on the spot with no notice. One of the best decisions I ever made. FYI I ended up with a much, much better job.

The second time my best friend was getting married, I had let my company (this is actually the company I work for now) know. They then ended up scheduling an important meeting. I made it clear I wasn't going to come, they said it wasn't a choice, I said I don't care. I didn't show up, my boss was mad at me, but nothing happened to me. However I still work for the same boss, he now respects my requests and understands that he might as well grant it because I'm going to do, what I'm going to do. This incident actually resulted in me missing a flight they paid for, and not showing up to a hotel, that they paid for.

Now, obviously, you have to be reasonable. If a new video game is coming out and you want to play that and your job really needs you, taking the time off regardless is not a good idea. However, if it is a major event, one that is probably never going happen again such as a wedding, a funeral, graduation, something life mattering significant. Do not allow your job to decide if you get to go to that function, it is not their choice, it is yours.",22640,573

It makes it sound like the person you're complimenting caused the thing you are complimenting them on. You are now complimenting their taste/judgement and not just an item in their posession

Criticism example: ""You stepped in dog shit"" vs ""**There is** dog shit on your shoe""

In contrast, when you're pointing out something negative, you don't want to sound like you're criticizing someone's judgement. An accusatory grammar structure to a criticism makes it sound like they're at fault for the bad thing, whereas passive grammar makes it sound like the bad thing is just something neutral that happens to exist in space/time, no faults attached.

This can also be extrapolated out to positive/negative things that don't have to do with personal appearance:

+ ""That was a good point"" vs ""You made a well reasoned point""

+ ""This tastes good"" vs ""You seasoned this perfectly""

- ""Someone broke the sink"" vs ""The sink is broken""

- ""You're being too loud"" vs ""The volume of this conversation is a bit high""

Leave.",TRUE,"I used to be a Training Specialist for a garbage call center some of you may know, called Sykes. It‚Äôs a third party call center that takes contracts/calls for other clients such as Intuit, Expedia, and many more. 

They generally pay as little as possible and are set out to hire anyone with a pulse that can make it through the day without actively using hard drugs on site. (Though that‚Äôs not always the case.)

Ive sat in front of hundreds of new hires and listened to upper management give the same speech about how everyone is there because they LOVE working with their clients and that there is endless possibilities within the company. Without fail at some point someone would say that dumb phrase. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre just here for a paycheck, leave‚Äù

My tip, If you‚Äôre working for a company like this, is leave. You‚Äôre worth more than that company will ever pay you for. Very rarely did it end up being the path to success that was promised to you during training and the interview process. At the end of the day the most valuable thing you bring to a company is yourself, make sure you‚Äôre getting paid what you‚Äôre worth.

Edit: Obviously I don‚Äôt mean storm out of the room like a angsty teenager. This instead should be the turning point where you start exploring other options. Learn what you should be looking for at your next job, the red flags you now are aware of and ask questions during your interview. 

For those asking if anyone I knew/taught actually left the room. Yes. Not always just because that statement but because some people can see through corporate propaganda from a mile away and making minimum wage isn‚Äôt worth joining a company with a ‚Äúclient is god. You‚Äôre a number‚Äù mentality.

I quit my job as a Training Specialist because I was tired of lying to desperate people who NEEDED that paycheck. They show up knowing what they‚Äôre in for initially and then some guy making $45,000 tells a bunch of people making $30,000 his life is perfect all thanks to Sykes. I‚Äôve seen that practice at other jobs and it‚Äôs all the same. 

I realized my worth, looked for a job that best for my career and salary goals and went for it. I‚Äôm now a project manager for a large payroll company and I fucking love it. But If someone hadn‚Äôt given me the same tip I posted here, I‚Äôd probably still be at Sykes. 

In the end. Know what you and your position is worth. Don‚Äôt get comfortable at a job you hate if it‚Äôs not making you financially stable. Be smart and plan ahead.

Edit 2: People still reading this as ‚Äúquit your job now‚Äù when that‚Äôs not the point of this post. However, those of you thinking that would definitely make great employees at Sykes.

Edit 3: A few people have mentioned various Sykes locations around the world in the comments wondering if it‚Äôs the one I worked at. Mine was in Central Florida but goes to show they‚Äôre all the same. 

Also, a few have posted that this reads as if I‚Äôve never struggled before and could afford to just leave a job without worry. First, please refer to my second edit. Second, without going into to much detail I spent a good portion of my life homeless and working various minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. I didn‚Äôt get my first car til I was 22 and only really became financially stable within the last 2 years. I was able to do this BECAUSE I recognized I was worth more than my current job at the time would ever pay me and ventured out of my ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù and it worked out. 

Once again the entire point of this post is don‚Äôt settle for a job where your value isn‚Äôt appreciated. There are other jobs and other companies where you can grow and develop a potential career that you may end up loving. Be smart. Ask questions. Make a Reddit thread where other faceless people can make wide assumptions on your life based off one post.

My wife and I foster shelter dogs that are about to be euthanized and train them for CGC certification then adopt them into loving homes.

Petting/rubbing their chest is a submissive gesture that almost instantly conveys that you are not going to harm the dog and that you are indeed praising it. This works for two reasons.

Story: The cable/internet provider's underground junction box on my corner had a broken latch, making the cover not sit correctly on the box. It's a big junction box, about 2'x4', and the kids who gather at the bus stop there were always playing with it and leaving it ajar. I wanted it fixed because (a) didn't want some kid getting hurt, and (b) eventually something would break and I'd lose my internet.

I called the customer service line several times and nothing got done.

So I called the corporate main number and asked for legal. Person asked how to direct my call and I told them I wanted to ask someone about their liability for injuries caused by their equipment.  Got a lawyer on the phone and told them about the situation, and that I was sure they would want to fix it ASAP because ""if a child gets hurt there I'm sure you don't want that liability falling on you.""

Like the European GDPR that came before it, it guarantees certain individuals rights around the use and sale of their data. More specifically, California residents can force companies to produce any data they have on them, and delete it on request.

**If you don't live in California, you can still benefit from this law**. It's too expensive and resource intensive to figure out where a person lives and see whether the law applies to them, so companies are adhering to most requests regardless.

The first one this runs into: just because an ambulance is called for you doesn't mean you have to ride in it, except in very specific exceptions (for example, if you are a minor with obvious injury and no parent present, or if you are inebriated by drugs/alcohol). As a mentally competent adult, you have the legal right to refuse treatment and transport via an ambulance, so if you don't want to receive treatment or ride to the hospital (ambulance bills are expensive, especially out of network), just say so (competent medics will *always* strongly recommend that you do, because it opens us up to liability if we don't- it doesn't necessarily mean we think you need it).

If your country has no stock, it's of course going to be pretty useless.** I work at a dealership, we do this often. This is just some advice that may differ slightly depending on your country's market at the moment, **if your new car market is doing well, give it a go** the worst that might happen is the sales rep will say sorry best I can do is X"", so there's really nothing wrong with giving it a go. Or you can get upset and comment anyway, up to you.

Independent dealerships that represent a particular brand (Mercedes, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Honda etc) and aren't owned by the brand themselves (for example Tesla), tend to compete against other dealership franchises in overall performance rankings to present themselves as better to the brand's headquarters. High performing dealerships get preferential treatment such as first choice with special models and are more likely to be have special requests accepted by the parent brand, so meeting monthly volume targets are a common metric to try and excel at.

Depending on your country and brand's rules, a 'new car sale' counts when a vehicle is ordered by the  dealership and then *registered*. If a car on the lot already has registration plates, it's already been counted as sold and is called 'pre-registered'. Dealerships do this to make their monthly volumes by essentially registering the car with the transport department for themselves, with the expectation they can move it next month or swap/sell it to other dealerships if stock is low and they have an in-demand vehicle. The latter also benefits them as in addition to initially counting as a new sale, that takes away a brand new sale + registration from the other dealership when that dealership requests the car since the competing dealer likely can't find it unregistered anywhere else to sell to their customer.

So this pro tip mostly applies if you're placing a new vehicle order, or looking at a vehicle on the lot without plates. Because they're not registered yet by the dealership, they're perfect for trying to negotiate a little harder on as if it's been a slow month for them, they'll likely take 5-10k (NZD) off the car and throw in a service plan just to make their target and avoid dropping down the rankings.

Everyday is a huge stress, which makes me a sort of expert in stress management. In times like that, even minor hiccups in your daily routine can derail your very fragile balance and sanity.  You may remember from your own experience how easily you can become unreasonably aggressive if you haven't been able to find something in your room for half an hour while being in a big hurry. Things like that, when thrown on top of the already present stress from a complicated life situation, can make you behave unreasonably and aggravate everything even more. Nobody knows how it's going to end, but you will unlikely benefit from it. 

Small things matter. That's where everything starts. The butterfly effect in action.

p2nib6,gomi-panda,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/p2nib6/,LifeProTips,"LPT: When engaging someone expressing big emotions, don't waste your time arguing/reasoning with the person. First listen, then summarize back to them what they said. Then identify and acknowledge their emotions. This is how you earn trust and their willingness to listen to your point of view.",TRUE,"What are charged emotions? Anything laced with anger, frustration, anxiety, arrogance, among other feelings. When people are experiencing these big emotions, their primary goal is usually validation that they are right. So wouldn't it backfire if you were to simply state your opinion?

But typically that's how interactions take place, where one person is feeling big emotions, and the other person gets overwhelmed and reactively pushes back by taking an equally hard line stance. Nothing but yelling, anger, and frustration comes from these types of engagement, and because no learning or shared agreement takes place, it becomes a near-total waste of time.

The basis of conversation is dialogue. A dialogue takes place when two or more people are able to reflect when they talk to others. But when people are emotionally charged, it's almost impossible for them to reflect on what they say or how they feel. Instead, when challenged, they double down on their point of view, and become even more abrasive. The fallout from this is a breakdown of trust.

Trust is the basis of human relationships. Without it, words are meaningless. So how to do you create trust? You start first by listening intently to what the other person is saying. Then restate their words in summary form to confirm that you understood what they are saying. They will confirm or correct your point of view. Then they will probably continue on talking and maybe even repeating what they have already said. That's ok. Oftentimes when people are feeling big emotions, they simply want to be heard and acknowledged.

Your job here is not to get them to understand your point of view. Your point of view doesn't matter if they don't trust you. And you build trust by becoming a doormat for the other person to unload their feelings. (If you can't do this yet, that's fine. Just walk away and try in the future when you feel you can do it). Once a person feels heard, you will notice that they visibly calm down. Dialogue doesn't easily happen unless people are able to be calm.

Once they have confirmed that you understand their story, you can begin to identify the feelings that they are feeling. State it back to them. ""It seems like you are really angry that I did that,"" or ""It seems like you are feeling a lot of anxiety about the future."" Now is not the time for you to talk other than identifying their emotions. Let them sit with the silence if they need to, until they can confirm or deny the feeling you pointed out. What matters here is the conversation is turning inward, and they are reflecting on their words and their feelings. You aren't there to deny or correct anything. You are there to listen, acknowledge, and validate. Over time, you will earn their trust. And trust is fundamental for all human interactions.

Once they trust you, you may be able to share your point of view and they might be able to listen to it, even if it is different from their own. Now you've started a dialogue based on empathy. And this is how relationships become transformative.

Edit: One additional point, as some people mentioned this in comments: this form of engagement does not work if you look at it like a passive aggressive ""technique"" to get what you want from another person. Unless you are genuinely committed to hearing out another person *without* having to have your own point of view validated in return, then this will come off as a manipulative exercise. Better to walk away from the conversation than create this dynamic.

Edit 2: More of an add on to edit 1. Words make up an extremely tiny portion of what a person remembers in a conversation. Your tone of voice, and primarily the SPIRIT underlying your words is what gets communicated. So for those repulsed by this as some sort of customer service technique, you have a point, and this can be used by someone to try to manipulate others. But that is not the point not the spirit here so do not get derailed. The spirit here is empathy and genuine enriching relationship with others. If you operate from a place of care and with your only goal being to encourage and uplift your friend, it's not likely they will accuse you of being manipulating.",20189,524

sbc11i,springyslinkies,FALSE,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/sbc11i/,LifeProTips,"LPT: if you value your quality of life, don‚Äôt enter a saturated field even if you‚Äôre really good. Especially if you‚Äôre really good.",TRUE,"I had to learn this the hard way from my experience in academia.

If you enter a really competitive and oversaturated field like humanities/social sciences academia or acting, art, music, professional sports, or pretty much anything where there is a world of difference between top and bottom earners with very few people at the top and hordes at the bottom, your results are going to depend on a few things:

1. Social privilege and other forms of luck. Self-explanatory. This will be the last time I‚Äôll mention this. 

2. Talent. By ‚Äútalent‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean just raw ability with the main skill itself, but the collection of relatively static traits and skills that play a role in how likely you are to be successful in that field. So, if you‚Äôre an aspiring actor, you obviously need to be able to act, but it also helps a lot if you‚Äôre attractive. This varies from field to field, but social skills and charisma are almost always relevant. 

3. How much bullshit you‚Äôre willing to tolerate. 

If you aren‚Äôt great in the talent department, you are likely to spend a lot of money on your education and will probably fail to find work that pays enough to pay the bills, if it pays at all. 

If you are truly a one-in-a-million superstar in your field, you may be able to bypass a lot of bullshit and this post doesn‚Äôt apply. And if you possess this level of talent, the people around you will probably make that obvious beginning pretty early in your life. In other words, if you have to ask about this, there‚Äôs your answer. 

But if you are like most people who choose competitive fields, you are probably very, but not exceptionally, talented (top ~1-5%, higher or lower depending on the field and how self-aware you are). Talented enough that people you respect and trust have probably told you a lot how good you are, and the concept of making it big seems reasonably possible. And you will be fighting for limited spots with people who are in the same exact boat as you. 

Talent generally occurs on a normal distribution. The further you get from average, the fewer people there are. There are arguably 1000 ‚Äúvery talented‚Äùs to every ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù person pursuing a career in any given competitive field. So when you‚Äôre at this purgatory level ‚Äî which almost everyone is, if they manage to actually get anywhere to begin with ‚Äî it comes down to who‚Äôs willing to take more bullshit. 

Who‚Äôs willing to work 70+-hour weeks, evenings, weekends, holidays, even overnights? Who‚Äôs willing to move across the country or world to a new location that is chosen for you every few years? Who‚Äôs willing to work for free or close to it? Who‚Äôs willing to spend all their free time working instead of with their family?

Who‚Äôs willing to undercut the competition and play dirty? Who‚Äôs willing to kiss ass? Who‚Äôs willing to keep their mouth shut about hostile work environments, harassment, incompetence, and abuse from higher-ups? Who‚Äôs willing to take it with a smile and dismiss or backstab anyone who speaks up?

That‚Äôs what decides which ‚Äúvery good‚Äùs make it. When 100 people are clamoring for 10 spots and they‚Äôre all very talented, the main thing that differentiates them is bullshit tolerance. And if you won‚Äôt deal with bullshit in a competitive field, someone just as good who will deal with it will be eagerly waiting to take your place. 

Lots of people go into competitive fields for idealistic and even altruistic reasons, but these environments make people desperate. Things like self-respect, boundaries, and having inconvenient values and morals are frowned upon if not outright punished. What will you do when you can‚Äôt look in the mirror because of the people you‚Äôve had to step on, lies you‚Äôve had to tell, and dicks you‚Äôve had to figuratively or literally choke on to stay afloat in your field? How will you reconcile this cold reality with your original vision of doing something meaningful, changing the world, and being yourself? In the face of what it all costs, will the meaning even matter? Will it make you happy? Is this really the only way to find fulfillment? Or have you just been spending your time around people who cling to that idea for dear life because they‚Äôre too terrified to face what it would mean for that to be a lie? What if instead, it‚Äôs a guarantee that you‚Äôll have to forget who you even are and endlessly disrespect yourself to chase a projected version of a ‚Äúdream‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist in the first place? Be honest with yourself. You deserve it. You *need* it. 

Bottom line: fighting for recognition in an oversaturated field renders you powerless. Different people have different levels of tolerance for this, but at the end of the day, prestige and bragging rights can‚Äôt tuck your children in at night. Avoid pyramid-shaped career paths. Unless you are truly exceptional, choose something secure and reliable and pursue your passion as a hobby.",20080,1741

Do five dishes and then leave it. Come back in an hour or two and do another five.

Edit: I know that everyone is different. I myself am admittedly not that old(19), and so there‚Äôs still a lot that I have left to learn.

Depression is a terribly lonely thing, and so I was hoping to create a section where we could get together and give each other tips. What works for me will definitely not work for everyone. But its worth saying because even if it doesn‚Äôt reach everyone, it still might inspire someone. 

So if you are different with the way you remain productive, please share it in the comments, I‚Äôm not used to having hundreds of comments but I‚Äôm reading all the ones that I can.
